Wanting to live forever, a mighty king sends his army of knights to find the Cup of Life. On this quest, you will summon knight after knight to be brutally sacrificed. Impale knights on spikes to create a safe path. Catch a knight on a sawblade to land the body on a button. Freeze knights into blocks of ice to reach higher ground.\n\nYou\u2019ll also electrocute knights to open doors, blast knights out of cannons, and even zombify a knight to be your violent, dim-witted friend. As you journey through treacherous and trap-ridden worlds, you\u2019ll show no mercy to solve each challenging puzzle.\n\nIn this game, death is not a setback. It is your only means to progress.",

        "description": "Welcome to Chasm, an action-adventure game in which you play a new recruit undertaking your first mission for the Guildean Kingdom. Thrilled to prove your worth as a knight, you track strange rumors that a mine vital to the Kingdom has been shut down. But what you discover in the mining town is worse than you imagined: The townspeople have disappeared, kidnapped by supernatural creatures emerging from the depths.\n\nHonor-bound to solve the mystery and restore peace to the Kingdom, you embark upon an epic adventure, with deadly battles against cunning monsters, exploration of ancient catacombs and castles, and powerful new equipment hidden at every turn. Though the overall story is the same for all players, your hero's journey will be unique: each of the rooms has been hand-designed, and behind the scenes Chasm stitches these rooms together into a one-of-a-kind world map that will be your own.",

        "description": "The two jello jelly creatures Bismo and Plom got connected in a tragic yet funny accident and thus can exchange their size and abilities at will. Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only game out there which doesn't take a closer look at the body mass index and where players are actually forced to work together (and occasionally stab each other in the back).\n\nExperience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds: \u25cf\tExplore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident! \u25cf\t Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests... \u25cf\t... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026 \u25cf\t... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves!\n\nThe twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability.\n\nThe game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content. Although the game is primarily meant to be played by two people, you can play the completely different singleplayer levels without another person.\n\nThe game features all the good things you should expect from a co-op platformer:\n\n\u25cf\tOver 40 levels of handcrafted fun \u25cf\tLocal co-op gameplay \u25cf\tExtra challenges/rewards in the levels for completionists and explorers \u25cf\tMore than 30 different levels designed for the singleplayer mode \u25cf\t8 unlockable bonuslevels (4 single- & 4 multiplayer) \u25cf\tAnd timechallenges for each level",

Instead of XP grinding, it introduces a Tainting Mechanics. While traveling through the shattered reality of the Sanctuary, you will receive personality traits based on your choices. These will be the main source of your strength. To harness them, you will have to act accordingly. Becoming an alcoholic means that you will be rewarded for getting drunk, but from that point being sober might prove to be unbearable.\n\nFEATURES - A unique Tainting Mechanic designed to encourage role playing - Tons of weapons, armor, and utility items - Dynamic and tactical combat build around stamina management and distance control - Optional stealth approach that complements fighting - Randomly generated, visually breathtaking levels - High difficulty level emphasized by permadeath mechanics - Gameplay\u00ad-driven narrative\n\nGAMEPLAY Before entering each level of the Sanctuary you get to choose a Taint that represents a certain personality trait. That choice will shape your future experiences as each Taint unlocks a new way of gaining power - a custom mechanic designed to encourage role-playing. Tainting Mechanics channels your will to survive into actions that are aligned with your hero\u2019s personality. Let\u2019s have a look at some examples:\n\nGreed - Receive \"Scrooge\" penalty for overpaying - The bigger fortune you Acquire the stronger you are\n\nFierce - Receive \"Rage\" boost after being wounded - Receive permanent passive bonus for killing enemies during \"Rage\"\n\nAs you go deeper into the Sanctuary you\u2019ll be able to add more Taints to your character\u2019s personality making the shifting levels of the dungeon itself a skill tree of a kind. However with each new Taint you\u2019re a step closer to the point of no return. Are you sure you know where it is?",

        "description": "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams \u2013Owltimate Edition is a blistering hardcore platformer with contrasting worlds. Warp Giana\u2019s vivid dreams to alter your abilities and destroy the twisted creatures lurking within. Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams \u2013 Owltimate Edition combines the challenge of retro era platforming with graphics that pack a visual punch and tight controls.\n\nFluidly morph between two dynamically different dream worlds to solve puzzles and combat grueling enemies. Players will have to intertwine sweet Giana's twirling jump attack with Punk Giana's hammering dash attack to survive the dualling dimensions.\n\nThe game sets up to 4 players against each other in local PvP, speed-running in an effort to push each other off the screen with the help of boosters and power-ups. \n\nSmash through all obstacles! Run, dash, jump, head bonk, fire cannonballs and barrages of bullets onto your opponents. Switch the level layout on the fly as you rush through dreamgates. Collect gems to fill your speed booster and use your power-ups to knock out the other players. \u2022\tPowerful Abilities: Change Giana's personality to unlock her unique abilities - you'll need to control both sides to survive her dreams! \u2022\tIntuitive Controls and Smooth Gameplay: Master the tight knit controls to defeat the cunning trials ahead. \u2022\tVisual Punch:Giana\u2019s dreamworlds leap off the screen with gorgeous 3D graphics that morph before your eyes. \u2022\tTwisted Puzzles: As Giana changes, so does the world around her. Collecting gems and finding secret locations requires strategy and interchanging the two worlds. \u2022\tLegendary Soundtrack:Each dream layer has its own music style. Experience a dual crossfading soundtrack by Chris H\u00fclsbeck and Machinae Supremacy! \u2022\tExplore and Discover: There are 23 rich levels across 3 distinct worlds, each transforming into the two contrasting dreamworlds. \u2022\tEpic Boss Battles:Take on gigantic creatures dredged from the depths of Giana\u2019s most terrifying nightmares. Each unique boss has only one thing in common with the others \u2013 they\u2019re utterly brutal! \u2022\tGut-wrenching Hardcore Modes: Hardcore and \u00dcber Hardcore modes also await players who are full masters of the game and quite possibly insane. \u2022\tA remixed \u201ceasy\u201d mode for all levels and bosses. The remixed mode is a lot easier to survive than its standard mode. The \u201ceasy\u201d difficulty for Giana should roughly correspond to the \u201cnormal\u201d difficulty for casual platformer games. \u2022\tExtras: 5 themed bonus levels accessible from the start.",

It didn\u2019t particularly end well for them, and to be honest, things aren\u2019t exactly great for another Jack and Jill either.\n\nIn Jack N\u2019 Jill DX, players must assume the role of Jack, overcoming many hazards, in a bid to reach Jill, who awaits him at the end of 140 levels, in typical old-school one-button platformer fashion! But, for the players who feel the guy should be the one who needs saving, we absolutely agree and that\u2019s why Jill is available as a playable character as well! \n\nFeatures: * 7 worlds made up of 20 levels each * 7 in-game mini-games., where you can earn tickets for the in-game store * In-game store with in-game tickets that are used for unlocking hats and screen colours * Mirror mode * 2 Playable characters",

        "description": "Howdy partner! Welcome to the Wild West, where lawlessness has broken out in GUN CITY. Trigger-happy desperado chickens have chased the righteous sheriff out of town. Nothing and no one are safe in this once-peaceful city. You're the new sheriff in town and must restore law and order by taking out these renegade chickens.\n\nIn each of the three levels, the aim is to hunt as many chickens and collect as many points as possible in just 90 seconds. But be careful \u2014 the desperados shoot back! If you get shot three times, the game is over. If you shoot the wrong chicken or the wrong item, points will be deducted. Not only do you have to be accurate, but you also have to complete certain tasks in order to progress to the next level. Which tasks? You have to find that out for yourself!\n\nLevel 1: On the prairie The first level takes place on the prairie. There's a torture stake, boxes, bottles, a prison and a bench. If you shoot off the prison's lock, a robber chicken will come out and try to rob the bank. To get to the next level, you have to reach at least 350 points, shoot the torture stake and ...\n\nLevel 2: In the Canyon In the second level, you are in front of GUN CITY, which can already be seen in the background. You\u2019ll also see a fisherman in his boat next to a tent, a farmer next to a crate of potatoes and a gold-seeker on his claim. To reach the next level, you have to reach at least 350 points, spruce up the canyon a little bit and ...\n\nLevel 3: In GUN CITY In the city, there are many buildings, a gallows and many chickens. Destroying the buildings\u2019 windows makes enemies appear. There are lots of surprises in this level, so you\u2019d better get moving in order to find all those hidden points.\n\nOTHER FEATURES: \u2022 Joy-Con\u2122 Speed \u2014 Choose one of three speed settings for maximum hunting success.\n\n\u2022 Rankings \u2014 Beat your own top scores over and over again and compete against friends and players around the world for the top position in the rankings.\n\n\u2022 Fairness \u2014 There are rankings for each level for touch players and rankings for players who play exclusively with the Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller.\n\n\u2022 Tutorial and FAQs \u2014 Tips and tricks to quickly become a respected sheriff.\n\n\u2022 Online/Offline \u2014 Play whenever and wherever you like. No internet connection is needed to hunt. However, you need an internet connection to put your best score on the global ranking and see other players\u2019 scores.\n\n\u2022 Community \u2014 With more than 15 million games sold, Moorhuhn is one of the best-known and most successful game characters. The chicken is off to the Wild West again with Moorhuhn Wanted, a game developed exclusively for the Nintendo Switch\u2122. Join the large Moorhuhn community now!\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Get the game and then go hunting crazy chickens in the Wild West!",

It\u2019s just another wonderful day out with the kids in Think of the Children, a frantic parenting simulator for up to four players. \n\nHauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering the lives of your children, the Prosecutors present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a day at the zoo, a camping trip, an unexpected visit to the Australian Outback and more. Each of these locations proves to be far more dangerous than they sound, and even the tamest of environments are filled with deadly hazards. \n\nRun solo, or team up with other parents to play through each trip in flashback to prove your parenting skills-and your innocence-to the judge, and avoid going to jail. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nMulti-tasking mayhem: There\u2019s never a dull moment when you\u2019ve got the BBQ to tend, picnic tables to set, some of the kids are playing with a rabid dog, and two of them just ran out onto the road.\n\nParenting is hard: To get a good parenting grade and avoid jail time you\u2019ll need to get all your tasks done, keep the kids happy, and\u2013ideally\u2013alive!\n\nNowhere is safe: The local park, the beach, the supermarket, the zoo. Great places for a day out with the kids. That is, aside from the poisonous berries, ravenous seagulls, towering grocery shelves and electrified pens.\n\nAll kinds of families welcome: Single parent? Two mums? A mum, two dads and a horse in a long distance relationship? It\u2019s all good. Parent solo or co-operatively with up to four players.",

Multiplayer allows either game mode, while single-player focuses entirely on real-time strategic gameplay.\n\nThe objective of each battle is to destroy the opponent\u2019s keep. To reach an enemy\u2019s keep, players must launch what is essentially the seed of a new structure, which will sprout into a new building upon landing and erect a wall connecting the new tower to the building that launched it. Each structure boasts its own capabilities, such as constructing other specific buildings, or spawning particular units. \n\nPlayers can decide to either quickly attack an opponent\u2019s base, adopt a more defensive strategy by fortifying their own headquarters or maintain a balance of offence and defence. Strategies are influenced by which of the two sides in the conflict players select.",

Boasting fully realized transport and economy systems, Cities: Skylines is designed to suit any play style - and now, anytime, anywhere.\n\nMore portable than ever, the new Nintendo Switch\u2122 edition of this best-selling city builder comes complete with reworked UI, designed especially for Nintendo Switch\u2122, along with two of Cities: Skylines\u2019 most popular expansions - After Dark and Snowfall. \n\nMulti-tiered and challenging simulation: Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor, you\u2019ll be faced with balancing essential requirements like education, healthcare and much more along with your city\u2019s real economy system. Citizens in your city react fluidly, with gravitas and an air of authenticity to a multitude of gameplay scenarios.\n\nNintendo Switch\u2122 Edition exclusive: Using HD Rumble, a rumble effect helps find the most efficient area to place service buildings in your city. Pro controllers are also supported, and additional tutorials help guide your first playthrough for a better learning experience.\n\nExtensive local traffic simulation: Colossal Order\u2019s extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is put to work in fully fleshed out, well-crafted transport systems.\n\nDistricts and Policies: Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city.\n\nAfter Dark: Focused on leisure and tourist specialization, this expansion\u2019s central feature is to utilize the day and night cycle and alter the approach to managing your city. Will you construct a bustling city that lives and breathes at night, or succumb to the perils and misadventures of the dark hours? \n\nSnowfall: The difficulty heats up when the city cools down, thanks to this expansion\u2019s added challenges and assets, like snow maps, streetcars, and heating systems. There are in-game temperature readings, cosmetic weather enhancements, extra parks, and infrastructural demands to keep your citizens warm and safe from freezing conditions.",

Skip straight to the operating table with the critically-acclaimed Surgeon Simulator CPR, fully revived and feeling better-than-ever on the Nintendo Switch\u2122! \n\nNow featuring all-new motion control functionality as well as local co-op play, it\u2019s time to scrub up for the most immersive version yet of the infamous operation sim! \n\n\nON CALL 24/7!\n\nStep into the shoes of Nigel Burke - a would-be surgeon with a less-than-conventional toolkit - as he performs terrifying transplants in theatre, high-pressure procedures in an ambulance, and anti-gravitational operations in space! Yes, operating on the go\u2019s never been easier thanks to the Nintendo Switch!\n\n\nMOTION (CONTROL) SICKNESS...\n\nFully compatible with the Joy-Con\u2122 controller, it\u2019s time to take Bob the patient\u2019s life into your own hands like never before! Play on the TV, in handheld mode, or using motion control functionality to perform life-saving operations with nail-biting precision. \n\n\nNEED SOMEBODY TO PLAY WITH?\n\nGot a bone to pick with your friends? With split Joy-Con\u2122 support, tag a second surgeon in at any time, whether it\u2019s at home or on the go, to immediately launch local co-op play!\n\n\nFEEL IT IN YOUR BONES!\n\nFrom hammers to hatchets, buzzsaws to laser pens, no operation\u2019s ever the same, and thanks to built-in HD Rumble, you\u2019ll truly experience every crunch, crack, splatter and splutter!\n\n\nContaining all the original heart-in-your-mouth (or wherever else you decide to put it!) operations, including the additional teeth and eye transplants from the A&E Edition, Surgeon Simulator CPR also includes the highly-classified Alien Autopsy mode, too! So what\u2019re you waiting for, doc? A man\u2019s life\u2019s on the line!\n\n\nA SECOND OPINION...\n\n\u201cMakes medical malpractice an absolute delight.\u201d - GAMESPOT\n\n\u201cIt's a darkly entertaining way to cut, explore, and appreciate the incredible skill of real surgeons.\u201d - IGN\n\n\u201cFew games take that odd, occasional gulf between what you intend to happen and what actually occurs on screen and fill it with such comedy.\u201d - EDGE\n\n\u201cI ended up hooked, playing it for hours, and I'm almost certainly not done.\u201d - TELEGRAPH\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing.\u201d - ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN",

        "description": "With an art style inspired by the 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s, FullBlast is a vertical-scrolling shooter that will bring a dose of nostalgia to all gamers who spent many an hour at their local arcade, engaging in Shmups. But don\u2019t worry, just because it\u2019s retro in origin, modern conventions and technology have been considered, resulting in a modern and vibrant presentation that is the perfect way to introduce a new generation of gamers to a largely untapped genre.\n\nTry to take in as much as you can, when you have the time though. Being a shmup, it\u2019s not just an alien menace you have to worry about, but their projectiles you\u2019ll need to dodge if you hope to survive! Across the game\u2019s 12 random levels, humanity is on the verge of extinction due to an alien invasion and it just so happens, you're the last hope to save the world. So, get ready to take flight and let loose, because those aliens are not going to shoot themselves. Humanity\u2019s retaliation starts here!\n\nFeatures: * Story campaign of 12 levels * 2 player local co-op mode * 4 Mini bosses and 3 Mega bosses * 3 Difficulty levels * Mission system and leaderboards * Gorgeous 3D graphics * Power-ups and power-downs (be careful of what you pick!!) * Heavy metal sound track",

When he goes searching for his crew, he makes a more startling discovery: evidence that humans have already been to this planet years ago! When he comes upon a deserted Soviet-era Russian town, he struggles to make sense of his mission. Did his light-speed travel to the planet send him back in time?

With four distinct environments with unique enemies, the challenge is always evolving. Multiple modes such as Rogue-like and Arena, and unlockable outfits with unique bonuses, will keep you coming back for more. Fear not the rogue-like though; with the Pussycat mode you can play the game with checkpoints in every level, in a classic linear adventure. This will not make it much easier though, fast reflexes and a keen eye are required in order to survive the journey to free your Master. You don't have to take this journey alone though; you can have a group of up to four people in local co-op!\n\nClaws of Furry can be played using one or two joy-con controllers for single and multiplayer! Connect more controllers to support up to 4 players!",

        "description": "In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.\n\nEventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.\n\nKey Features - Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. - 3 game modes: Normal for quick games, Endless for stress-free play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge. - 20 real-world cities to design subways for. Each has a unique colour theme and set of obstacles. - Supports up to 4 players. Build with your friends and argue over the best design. - Trains! Did we mention them yet?",

So by delivering pirate video tapes to his customers and staying one step in front of the cops, he quickly became... The Videokid.

Is today the day he'll finally reach her in time? \n\nThe VideoKid pays homage to the 1980s, and the classic videogames of that era.

        "intro": "Run, fight, and maneuver through the colorful 2D world of Avalice!",
        "description": "The planet Avalice has long known a tenuous peace thanks to the Kingdom Stone: an orb of unknown origin that outputs enough free energy to power every device in the world, seemingly without limit.\n\nThe Kingdom Stone is beginning to weaken, however, and the planet\u2019s three ruling houses are poised to engage in all-out war over control of this most precious resource. Add to that a coup d\u2019etat within one of these houses \u2013 instigated by an invading alien army \u2013 and Avalice\u2019s future is looking grim. Enter, our three unlikely protagonists: the dragon, Sash Lilac, who unwittingly gets involved when she witnesses a strange airship crash-land and grows concerned for the well-being of its pilot; the wildcat, Carol Tea, whose dedication to her best friend leads her to undertake whatever challenges fate throws her way; and the orphaned puppy, Milla Basset, whose quest for nothing more than mere companionship inadvertently brings her directly into the line of fire.\n\nTogether, this trio of anthropomorphized heroines must somehow ingratiate themselves to each of the three houses, stop an all-out alien invasion, and learn the secret nature of the Kingdom Stone before its power wanes\u2026and before a world war breaks out around them.  Freedom Planet is a fast-paced combat-driven platform adventure that pits a spunky dragon girl and her friends against hostile foreign powers and alien attack forces. There's trouble around every turn, from insects to giant robots to sheer explosive destruction, but players will have a variety of special fighting abilities at their disposal to blast through more than a dozen massive, nonlinear stages. The campaign may be played through as Lilac, Carol, or the unlockable Milla, each of whom has completely unique gameplay mechanics, an altered story mode in which the selected character takes the lead, and even a few of her own unique stages.  KEY FEATURES  Gorgeous 2D pixel art with meticulous detail and a grand, rocking soundtrack Lush multi-scrolling backdrops are layered behind minutely detailed stages, each populated with a variety of lovingly animated characters and most backed by at least two unique music tracks per stage, along with unique music for almost every boss battle.  Three playable characters with completely different strengths and abilities Use Lilac\u2019s dragon powers to hair-whip enemies, spin like a cyclone, or blaze through the skies like a comet; use Carol\u2019s feline agility to cut through foes with punches and kicks, scale walls, or summon a gravity-defying motorcycle; and use Milla\u2019s mighty basset-hound ears to fly short distances, or call upon her canine magic to create deadly cubes which can be tossed at foes, compressed into a directional shield, or fired off as if from a rifle.  Momentum-based platforming and combat in a wide variety of settings Use the game\u2019s tight controls to reach incredible speeds and heights, exploring massive stages full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden collectibles. Send enemies flying, fight screen-filling bosses, dodge lasers, ride mine carts, hop from airship to airship, and more!  Follow the story, or just play the game; it\u2019s all up to you Play in \u201cAdventure Mode\u201d to enjoy the game\u2019s intense and dramatic story, with over an hour of unique cutscenes and full voice-acting, or pick \u201cClassic Mode\u201d to do away with cutscenes entirely and simply play the stages for a streamlined gameplay experience.",

        "description": "Form your party (a group of secret agents) from among four races: Human, Oni, Tengu, and Nekomata. Then conquer the terrifying and mysterious Yokai-filled castle!\n\n\u25a0The Yokai in Hyakki Castle The game reproduces Yokai from ancient Japanese literature, including the giant skeleton Gasha Dokuro and a Yokai made up of a woman's head and arm. Many creepy and terrifying monsters will appear. They await your secret agents (players) in Hyakki Castle. Powerful bosses will be unleashed at certain points as you make your way up through the castle. Aim for the tower, where the master of the castle awaits!\n\n\u25a0Main Theme: Dan no Ura Dan no Ura, an original song by the Biwa player Sae Ishida, creates a creepy atmosphere.\n\n\u25a0About Real Time Dungeon RPGs \"Real time dungeon RPGs play like an action game, in which you move around and fight on a floor with a grid layout. With the exception of some portions, the game plays out in real time.\n\nWhen in combat, the enemy won't wait for your attack.\n\nBattle by avoiding enemy attacks and timing your own attacks at the right moment.\"\n\n\u25a0A Yokai-Filled Castle with Death Looming Around the Corner The player's secret agents will storm Hyakki Castle, where formidable Yokai and terrifying traps await. Be careful. One miss will cost you your life. Eat the food you find in the castle to survive. An empty stomach will lower your stats.\n\nThere's nowhere to relax in this castle. Eat, sleep, destroy Yokai, and search the castle.\n\nIn the Yokai-filled Hyakki Castle, you're always one step away from death.\n\n\u25a0The 2 Party System \"The game has a split party system that uses the Tokugawa treasure item Ishin no Ofuda. The player can freely split up into two parties at any time (the game will go into split screen mode). When necessary, split into two teams to deal with the traps and challenges in the room. In addition, the party you aren't controlling will use spells to temporarily harden themselves, increasing their stamina. Attack enemies from the rear to deal massive damage. Use the hardened party with high stamina as a decoy, and send the other around to the back.\"",

        "description": "You play a bipedal frog employed by the mysterious start- up company 'Cat & Frog Inc.'. Fend off enemies seeking to stop you and overcome the challenging landscape as you head towards your destination.\n\nWhen you start the game, you'll likely be surprised by your paltry amount of life and your dodgy weapon. And when the frog runs out of life, he 'enters hospital' and has to restart from the beginning of the stage. But you can keep collecting and saving up money to go 'shopping' to increase your life and carefully select powered-up weapons to take down enemies you couldn't defeat before. The further you get, the stronger you can feel yourself becoming - and it feels good.\n\nThe characters appearing in between stages are the game's other charm point. You'll meet your co-worker, who is a cat (for some reason), your president (also a cat), and an office lady of indeterminate species. They work like us, slog through overtime like us, whinge, get berated, and even comfort each other, just like us.\n\nExperience the unique and intricately detailed world of Kero Blaster!",

After spending three years in jail, you just want to live an honest life and recover your daughter. However, the quirky clients of The Box will drive you closer to your turbulent past, involving you in a gangster scheme that threatens to destroy everything that you love.\n\nEvery night, among the club\u2019s visitors, you\u2019ll find undercover cops, annoying celebrities, runaway criminals or ghosts from your past. As the new gatekeeper of The Box, you decide who enters and who doesn\u2019t... by any means necessary. Be careful though, because each choice you make can influence the fate of the club and its clients. You\u2019ll also need to keep your salary to avoid being evicted, to see your daughter again, and most importantly, to regain control of your life.  Will you let teenagers into the club in exchange for money? Will you confront a wealthy client to save his girlfriend when she asks you for help?

They expect the royal treatment. - Beware of the people that enter the club. If you let rock fans in during an elite party, they may wreak havoc! - The Box also organizes special events like St. Patrick\u2019s, a day where everyone can get drunk and enter the club!\n\nExperience different storylines depending on your choices: - Will you flirt with your boss\u2019 girlfriend? - Will you work with the police? - Will you get along with a powerful but annoying gangster?

        "description": "Polygod is a rogue-like, randomly generated, single & multiplayer FPS with a brutal difficulty curve!\n\nBlending a fast-paced, Quake-esque feel with randomness, difficulty and our handcrafted power-up system, Polygod is a hardcore gamer and speedrunner's dream. Only the most skilled and strategic players will defeat the Trial of the Gods.\n\nYou are a Faceless One: a one-armed, gun-wielding assassin of legend. The seven deities of Polygod will test your skill with randomly generated arenas of hostile minions, followed by a boss fight against a ruthless Holy Champion.\n\nEach of the arenas features five Altars of Worship, offering you Blessings in exchange for Souls you have collected along your journey. Blessings combine and stack to create unique gun effects, but each has consequences, so choose wisely if you wish to survive each wicked challenge. And don\u2019t forget, death is permanent in this purgatory of the gods!\n\nThe art style is inspired by the meta-physical surrealist artist Giorgio de Chirico who is famously revered for his eerie mood and strange artificiality of cityscapes.\n\nMain Features: A unique, randomly generated experience every time. Randomise the levels, blessings offered and enemy placement with our seed system, or challenge others on specific seeds!\n\nGun customisation with 100 unique blessings. Each seed will offer you a different selection of blessings as you progress through the levels. Strategically combine and stack them to fit your personal playstyle. Ever wondered what it would be like if your bullets were bubbles? Well, what if they were bubbles AND proximity mines? And you shot 3 of them at once? AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT? The options are endless! Do you choose a lethal sniper build, or a bullet wall of death? How will you survive: lifesteal, jump-strafe dodging, tank-like health? How do you want to navigate the environment: double jump, helicopter boots, teleportation?\n\nAdditional Features: Splitscreen co-op Gyroscope aiming supported 35 unique enemies 15 unlockable playable characters 7 epic boss fights against Holy Champions 7 even harder Red Holy Champions Special Boss Blessings Experimental soundtrack Minimalist, colourful artstyle Quirky NPCs",

Governments and companies promise remedies through technological progress. Drones and humanoid robots replace humans in the public sector, everything is interconnected, surveillance has become omnipresent.\n\nRichard Nolan is one of the few journalists openly criticizing this development. When he wakes up in hospital after an explosion and finds that his wife and son have mysteriously vanished, Richard realizes: he and his family have become more than just bystanders in a storm of rivaling ideas pertaining humankind\u2019s salvation between dystopian reality and digital utopia. Instead, they find themselves right at the center of it.\n\nThis domestic drama evolves into a thriller about a worldwide conspiracy, which at its core aims to determine the fate of humanity: Could a perfect digital utopia be the answer? A virtual paradise not affected by material needs and quarrels? Could a super-AI be our savior \u2013 or would it simply declare us as dispensable since it could not be taught the value of philanthropy?\n\nWhat will the world look like after this storm, what will remain of humanity?\n\n\u00b7 Experience an alarmingly realistic vision of the near future \u00b7 Dive into a multi-layered Sci-Fi thriller, where dystopian reality and digital utopia are intertwined \u00b7 Unravel a global conspiracy in a society of ubiquitous digitalism, surveillance and transhumanism \u00b7 Explore a world with a rich and unique visual style, combining realistic environments with low-poly characters \u00b7 Take on the role of journalist Richard Nolan, as well as five additional playable characters \u00b7 Use dexterity, deductional skill and research to reconstruct Richard's past",

A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park.

        "description": "Loot Monkey: Bling Palace is the sequel to Loot Monkey and builds on the sweet essence of 1980s video games with colourful modern graphics, designed to look great at 1080p. There is also original cheesy synth music and constant taunts from his master, the Evil Overlord (he just wants all the blingy loot).\n\nAn extra feature is a choice of game mode for a variety of challenges and gameplay options. There is a practice mode for those who wish to jump straight into any room in the Bling Palace (requires room name, all are fixed and can be swopped freely, no unlocks/keys required). And there are harder modes for those who think extra lives are for wimps. The hardest mode is only for the brave: Dougie has one life and no extra lives can be added to it.\n\nBe a clever, brave monkey and gather the master's loot but don't step in the vomit.",

Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert. He has been petrified for three years, though. With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he\u2019s actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the handle - and who Robert loves, with a capital L. Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.",

Beneath crumbling, salt-worn structures, labyrinthine passageways lead to unspeakable evil, long forgotten by man.\n\nSalt and Sanctuary seamlessly combines fast, brutal, and complex 2D combat with richly developed RPG mechanics. Discover, craft, and upgrade over 600 weapons, armor pieces, spells, and items as you explore a cursed realm of forgotten cities, blood-soaked dungeons, desecrated monuments, and the fallen lords they once celebrated.\n\nFrom Ska Studios, the award-winning indie studio behind a long list of stylistic, visceral, and brutally executed action titles that includes The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile, The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai, and Charlie Murder, comes Salt and Sanctuary, the studio\u2019s most ambitious title to date.",

        "intro": "Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 revives the good, old, action platform run & gun genre, but this time with a bunch of humor and buckets of blown off body parts. In this sequel to Guns, Gore & Cannoli, Vinnie Cannoli\u2019s story continues and this time it\u2019s personal. ",
        "description": "Welcome to the 1940\u2019s. Europe is being torn apart by the war, the USA is preparing for battle and the mob does business as usual. Only this time they went too far, even for Vinnie\u2019s standards. Prepare yourself to go to war after you make a shocking discovery about what actually happened during the end-stage of the Thugtown Massacre from Guns, Gore & Cannoli 1.\n\n\"Just when you thought you were out, we\u2019re pulling you back in!\"\n\nStory 1944, the war in Europe is entering its final stage. 15 years have passed since Vinnie survived the Thugtown Massacre. But now, some loose ends start crawling out of the past, dragging Vinnie as far as the European battlefield of World War 2. Find out who is chasing Vinnie around like a dog, turning all his friends into foes.\n\nKey features:\n\nGuns, Gore & Cannoli 2 continues the rich, engaging gangster story of the first game and includes all the fast paced action you\u2019ve come to love, we made the best even better, with:\n\nUpgraded character mobility Vinnie has received a massive upgrade in his mobility features. 360 aiming, double jumping, kicking, jump-kicking, dodge rolls, somersaults, dual guns and a weapon wheel.\n\nCampaign mode Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 features a full single or multiplayer campaign mode, packed with action, humor and animated cutscenes.\n\nRich environments We pushed our artists to the limits to produce the best immersive, atmospheric backgrounds, smoothest animations, and coolest special effects, setting a new benchmark for 2D games. Look for opportunities to bring down walls, explode barrels, drop crates on top of enemies, blow up cars and even kick your enemies through doors. Enjoy watching the corpses of your enemies fly through the air like ragdolls after you blast them away with your rocket launcher.\n\nImmersive world and period Walk around in the European battlefields of World War 2. Every level of Guns, Gore & Cannoli breathes the 1940\u2019s. Every inch of the game is like a picture straight from the second World War era. The cars, the furniture, the speakeasy clubs, the music, the propaganda posters, the streets and the weaponry reflect the turbulent time that the 1940\u2019s were.\n\nOnline and local Co-op mode You don\u2019t want to die alone in the trenches? Well round up a platoon of 4 players and get blasting. Play as Vinnie in the solo campaign, or with up to 3 friends together while fighting through hordes of Nazis, zombies, monster, gangsters, cops, soldiers, tanks, submarines... in this all-new and incredibly fun arcade-style co-op action game. Teamwork is essential to surviving waves of enemy goons.\n\nHumor \u2018War is hell\u2019 unless you are Vinnie Cannoli and you turn every problem into a cynical joke, blurting out one-liners and snappy comments after a nice, juicy kill. Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 will be a fun experience, not only to play but also to watch. Funny one-liners, screaming deaths, comical dialogs and hilarious enemies make you play this violent kill-simulator with a smirky grin on your face.",

Eliminate the criminal underworld of the city\u2019s three major districts and persuade undecided voters to your cause, tackling the issues that matter by putting a gun in the mouth of those issues. \n\nThrough the power of ISO-Slant\u2122 technology and a wasted youth, London-based developer Roll7 (OlliOlli) delivers the greatest 2\u00bcD cover-based indie shooter of all-time, ever.\n\nNext Level Shootouts \u2013 Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts. The intuitive quick-snap cover system lets you slide, roll, and dive into cover, dodging enemy fire before fighting back with tackles, executions, and 100s of bullets.\n\nRoster of Not Heroes - Select between 9 different heroes, each with their own distinct gameplay style and crime murdering abilities. Blast the city\u2019s scum through doors with Cletus\u2019 a shotgun, slice them in half with Kimmy\u2019s katana dash, or simply bash crime in it\u2019s terrible face with Ronald\u2019s hammer.\n\nDynamic Missions \u2013 Go ham on primary objectives and (sometimes random) secondary goals but be prepared for unexpected mid-level events that turn the tables on the anti-heroes in an instant. SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and victory.",

You went to visit the concert hall where the lower note echoes rhythmically with vibration. Tonight, the one playing music is the Visual-Kei band \u201cFOX EAR\u201d. All 5 unique members are wearing a fox ear. Once you hear their voices, the magatama (comma-shaped beads) that you have on your neck beams out the light. This dazzling light made me lose my consciousness and taken back to \u201cFOX EAR\u201d \u2019s dressing room. As they pressure you to give them the magatama, but as magatama seems out the light again as if to protect you... Although the 5 members noticed that they can\u2019t take it by force, they tried to make you fall for them to get magatama\u2015\u2015.\n\n- Characters Ak!to(\u6681\u4ec1) / CV : Mamoru Miyano (\u5bae\u91ce\u771f\u5b88) KASUM!

Without it, you'd fail even harder. - Epic Storyline: Not included. Instead, be guided by floor texts that make fun of you when you fail and drop awful puns even if you unexpectedly don't. - Scavenger Hunt: Discover secret areas that lead to other secret areas which in turn lead to other secret areas. You get the idea, and maybe even the rainbow that awaits you at the end of the treasure. Probably you'll just google it though. - Speedrolling: Replay levels in Rush mode as fast as you can and prove that you are a good person by beating other players' highscores. - Style your Balls: Be rewarded with awesome bonus contents like tasty new colors and trail effects for your balls.",

They have created perverse constructions for their services under the pseudonym\u00a0Black Butterfly.\n\nOne of their terrifying secret buildings was Prison S-313, created in 1968 in a barren area unknown to mankind.\n\nPoliticians, spies, inventors and anyone who may harm those who really control the world and who live in the shadows, were imprisoned and the rest\u00a0disappeared.\n\nDarkness and incomprehension overcame them all, subjecting them to all kinds of barbarity.\n\nMany prisoners and non-prisoners perished and their spirits remained trapped within\u00a0its walls.\n\nThis is now a ghost prison where everything that happened remains in the past.\n\nOur reckless and difficult mission will be to free\u00a0these hateful spirits.\n\n\n- Play by\u00a0conspiring against governments and secret institutions.\n\n- Either participate or don\u2019t! In certain areas of the game, you'll\u00a0find small tests that you can take. If you pass them, you win a reward. The decision to accept the challenge or not depends solely on you!\n\n- In the virtual store, you can get or buy all of the many weapons with specific uses for each adverse situation. There are two types: consumables and others that come\u00a0loaded and never run out.\n\n- Replayability with various challenges to overcome.\n\n- Big, difficult-to-defeat bosses.\n\n- Dark, desolate and extremely hostile environments.\n\n- A style of Metroidvania gameplay and a Rogue-like philosophy.\n\n- Get the infinite jet pack and experience new sensations.\n\n- As a Rogue-like game, you have two options when starting a new game, you choose:\n\n   * With a new seed you will have a different generation of the game.\n\n   * With the same seed, you will have an identical game situation.\n\n- Don\u2019t miss out on this adventure as it will continue on with future chapters in new conspiracies.",

You play as a team, fighting your way through randomly generated rooms filled with various types of enemies, picking up insane magitech guns on the way. Shooting stuff up is simple and hilarious, but only the best of teams can make it all the way back to the evil they've created.\n\nFIVE-SECOND LEARNING CURVE Almost anyone can play NoReload Heroes, from the casual player to the seasoned gamer. No matter how many times someone dies, they can always be revived, as long as at least one of you stays alive. On the higher levels, it will not be so easy... Still, you only use a couple of buttons, and best of all, no need to reload! Simple but intense, laugh-out-loud fun.\n\nUNIQUE GAMEPLAY SESSIONS Randomly generated levels, 70+ unique magitech weapons, 43 enemy types and 3 bosses will give you a different gameplay experience every time. There's no way you could meet every enemy type during one session, we've made sure of that. Can you ascend through the maze-like construction to defeat the evil AI you have created? Work as a team to stay alive, or it\u2019s back to the bottom floor with you!\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY Squeeze onto a couch with your buddies. If someone's late, they can use hot join to jump in at any point. NoReload Heroes is paced for conversation and designed for social situations, like parties and game nights. We want people to be happy together!",

        "description": "Semblance is a innovative platformer with deformable terrain, set in a beautiful minimalist world. It\u2019s a game that asks, what if you could deform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a \u2018platform\u2019 in a platformer and turns it on it\u2019s head. What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems? Explore a world where the default is soft, where the property of 'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay: Can\u2019t reach a collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and push-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.\n\n\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design: Explore 3 worlds bursting with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become hypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.\n\nExplore non-linearly: The game allows you to move between puzzles as you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.",

        "description": "Pool Panic frees billiards from the table and unleashes it into a world where everything from jungles and deserts to cities and swamps is a living pool game! You already know that sinking eight balls is the ultimate goal, but can you succeed while contending with monster balls chasing you, or ballerina balls leaping away from your well-aimed shots?\n\nTake on the role of the mischievous, and dare we say, oblivious cue ball in Pool Panic's unique world comprised of 100+ levels while enjoying the single-player campaign, or invite your friends to join you for a multiplayer panic.\n\nFeatures: -Single player campaign includes a large world with over 100 levels that span music festivals, mines, diners, the wild west, caverns, farms, and more! -Local multiplayer for up to four players. Multiple control modes supported, including two players on a single Nintendo Switch\u2122, using a single Joy-Con\u2122 per player. -Panic Mode pits your pool skills against the clock, but don't forget that all the other balls are just as animated and alive as you, so different balls react differently to hits! -Discover the unique characteristics of dozens of different balls and the strategies required to pot them, even as they use their unique skills to try and thwart your efforts. -Fight a swamp monster, light up a derelict lighthouse, battle a biker gang, puke on a pirate ship, flee zombieballs after raising the dead, foil a bank heist, even joust! Seriously, you can ride a horse ball and joust. -Express yourself! White cue balls such as yourself can use a little pizzazz, so enjoy trying on the 80+ different hats you're able to steal from other balls in the game.",

        "description": "\"Ghost\" is a metroidvania where two super hackers hire a mysterious agent in order to infiltrate the Nakamura Space Station and steal the greatest electronic secret ever. Of course, the space station will defend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, with their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to be destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find out about their agent's hidden ties...\n\nWEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No need to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body.\n\nUPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are.\n\nITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls.\n\nGEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.\n\nSECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special.\n\nMAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss.\n\nSTORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English.\n\nGAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die.\n\nSKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way.\n\nAnd the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just have to discover the rest on your own.",

Red Hot Ricochet is an intense game of ricochet duels, and you'll need wise shooting, lucky bounces, and a bit of triggernometry to win.\n\nEach player is armed with a gun that shoots bouncing bullets, allowing you to ricochet your shots based on your ammo count. You'll use the rocks around you both as cover and a way to hit your opponents where they least expect it. When you're not giving your enemies a lethal dose of lead, you can also use your bullets to grab powerups, revive dead allies, or gain a burst of speed. Use your ammo wisely, or you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot (literally).\n\nYou can't all make it out of this desert alive, so make sure the bullets bounce your way. Find the best rocks, envision the tastiest angles, and pull the fastest trigger - or someone else will.",

        "description": "Hiding behind the mask of the average man on the street, and furtively blending into the background, many war criminals, ex-Mafia members and other criminals have been literally getting away with murder, or worse. That is, until you turned up to ruin the party. As part of a secret and\u00a0mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way, using your unpredictability to your advantage.\n\nTrack the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one. But bear this in mind: each criminal\u2019s death has to look like an accident. In each level, you\u2019ll have the chance to splatter and destroy the Bad Guy using various weapons and traps. It\u2019s up to you to make sure he ends up in the wrong place at the right time.\n\nIn this ingenious puzzle game in which physics plays an essential role, you\u2019ll need to keep a cool head and your wits about you. Show no mercy as you set out to kill the Bad Guy! \u201cUntil your mission is accomplished we don\u2019t exist. If you fail, you\u2019ll be the only person at fault, and we\u2019ll deny ever knowing you.\u201d\n\nFeatures TRACK YOUR TARGET in 60 levels, each one more original than the last, and unlock 6 completely off-the-wall bonus levels. USE YOUR IMAGINATION as you take out the criminals one by one. Find the opportune moment to act, and make it as bloody as you can! BECOME THE AMBASSADOR OF DEATH and make full use of all the different traps available. Sabotage vehicles, transform daily objects into deadly weapons, or combine different elements in order to create new ones. WORK IN THE SHADOWS. Don\u2019t draw attention to yourself. Cameras, pedestrians, cops and the Bad Guys\u2019 bodyguards mustn\u2019t suspect you. No one should ever doubt that these deaths are anything but unfortunate accidents. TRY, TRY AND TRY AGAIN as you take advantage of the game\u2019s replay feature. Get the top score, fulfil the secondary objectives, find new ways to kill each Bad Guy, and work on your murder skills. SHOW OFF your killing prowess and achievements to your friends, and prove that you are the world\u2019s top justice seeker.",

Players are asked to answer increasingly uncomfortable questions in secret, while their companions try to guess the outcome. \n\nHEATED CLASSICS! Pineapple on pizza, yay or nay? RELATIONSHIP CHOICES! What part of your partner do you prefer, body or face? HORRIBLE DILEMMAS! If you could only save the life of one, would you choose a 1-year-old or an 18-year-old?\n\nWhether you deduce correctly or incorrectly, games of Awkward help players see each other in a brand new light. And your opinion counts: each Awkward question will let you compare your vote to the rest of the world. Banned for over 120-years, Awkward is back, and you can now enjoy this controversial adult card game as a videogame.\n\nQUALITY GAMEPLAY Featuring the original banned questions, as well as all new content written by Danny Gallagher (Quiplash, Fibbage 2) and Joanna Haslam (Buzz! Quiz World, It's Quiz Time). One to six players can join in, with a huge selection of game modes on offer.

        "description": "Dream Alone is a 2D platforming game with classic platform gameplay, deadly traps, a dark storyline and unique hero abilities. \n\nA mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels including a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. \n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! \n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.\n\nFEATURES: - Unique gameplay due to alternative reality levels and time warp feature - Varied game mechanics - Grayscale graphic with original \u201cold horror\u201d camera effects - Enigmatic story reminiscent of dark fairy tales - Beautiful minimal soundtrack - 21 levels full of disturbing story",

        "description": "The critically-acclaimed puzzle game produced by legendary creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi arrives on the Nintendo Switch\u2122 console! An HD remaster of the original game, LUMINES REMASTERED beautifully marries the elements of sound, light and puzzle-action into one addictive, yet easy-to-play game. \n\nYou\u2019re at the center of the high-energy, block-dropping action while you groove to awesome house, trance and techno beats! Play LUMINES REMASTERED on-the-go in handheld mode or at home in TV mode and tabletop mode. \n\nFeel the sound: Play over 40 skins with electronic atmospheres from chill to upbeat. Shuffle skins (like a music playlist) as more are unlocked in a new Shuffle mode.\n\nFeel the challenge: Faster tempos means less time to make combos, but slower songs can mean uncleared stacks. You\u2019ll get hooked.\n\nFeel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.\n\nFeel the vibration: Turn on Trance Vibration and sync up to four Joy-Con\u2122 controllers to feel the bass across your body.",

        "description": "You are in the role of Dr. Brunhild Stahlm\u00fcller, an acomplished weapon scientist who upgrades a WW1 triplane with superior alien technology to attack the invaders. You will avenge mankind and take the battle into the darkness of space until you reach an ancient alien world.\n\nFeatures \u2022\tFight from Verdun to the heart of the alien world! \u2022\tMajestic and extravagant pixel art inspired by the golden age of arcades. \u2022\tAccessible with a fair difficulty curve. \u2022\tIntense action and highly polished gameplay \u2022\t8 stages with huge boss encounters. \u2022\tBloodshed and gore. \u2022\tPsychedelic soundtrack.\n\nStory The year is 1917 - war engulfed the earth. Billions were slaughtered at the hands of unprecedented technology in the name of fanaticism. Yet all previous atrocities were as preambles to an even greater, unforeseeable catastrophe. When on the 15th of April, a host of aliens descended from war-torn skies and opened fire indiscriminately on soldier and civilian alike, the foundations of the world were shaken and mankind would face his darkest hour. Against such a terrifying, overwhelming foe, the scrambling, exhausted nations of Earth had no choice but to put aside their old grudges and fight side by side if they wanted to avert total extinction \u2013 or worse. Still, courage and unity were not enough to match the sheer power of a species so advanced that the very cosmos proved no obstacle to them.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. Brunhild Stahlm\u00fcller, an accomplished scientist, worked tirelessly with her assistant, Harmuth Griesgram, on developing an experimental airplane codenamed the Red Beezlebub. Based not only on existing aeronautical technology but also on fragments of alien wrecks from the recent battlefields, this new invention is capable of prolonged atmospheric flight as well as deep, interstellar travel. Finding no pilots left in any condition \u2013 bodily or mentally \u2013 to take the pilot seat, the brave doctor dons the helmet herself and takes the Red Beezlebub on her virgin flight; to the battlefields of Verdun. Her target: the Chessmaster, the new, self-crowned king of humanity. An usurper and abomination. Fueled by gasoline and hatred, her Valkyrie's flight will end either in blood-soaked victory or glorious death. Little did she know that he himself is only a piece on the real player's board, and she is watching Brunhild's every move with greedy, leering eyes\u2026",

Beat your personal record and compete with players around the world.\n\n\u2022 1 vs. 1 duel \u2014 The goal is to hunt more chickens than a friend in only 90 seconds! Every player uses a single Joy-Con\u2122 to target and shoot the chickens.\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer \u2014 Two to four players alternate on the hunt for chickens and points. Who aims better and shoots faster? There's only one way to find out. Load your rifle, and let's go!\n\n\u2022 Leaderboards \u2014 See how your single-player high score compares with those of your friends and other members of the community.\n\nNEW: \u2022 Joy-Con Speed \u2014 Choose one of three speed settings for maximum hunting success.\n\n\u2022 Pure fairness \u2014 From now on there is a leaderbord for touch players and another leaderboard for players who play exclusively with the Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.\n\nOther features \u2022 Tutorial and FAQs \u2014 Read up on game tips and tricks to quickly become a successful chicken hunter.\n\n\u2022 Online/Offline \u2014 Play whenever and wherever you like.

        "description": "Introduction\n\nGenoq Governing Board Briefing Excerpts/Virtual Conference 26 June 2021 09:14 Originated in Paris N. Eco speaking\n\n.. We fear that the workers trapped in our Singapore lab have little chance of survival. Those of you familiar with the Neogen organisms produced in this lab would agree that any rescue attempt would be a suicide mission. The remaining survivors are beyond hope.\n\nPrior to the outbreak, our recon satellites spotted an explosion near the top of the building. This is where Derrida, our head scientist, is creating the next Neogen prototype, the D/Generation.\n\nThe D/Generation represents an extremely advanced stage of artificial evolution. Equipped with sophisticated neuro-holographic camouflaging, it can disguise itself as anything. It also has a super-hardened dermal layer that acts like a sheet of armour, malting it virtually indestructible.\n\nWe are now forced to accept the unthinkable, that the D/Generation is loose in the building. But this might only be the beginning. If it were to escape from the labs out into the real world, the D/Generation would threaten every person on this planet...\n\nYour Objective\n\nAlone with your jetpack, you have flown from Finland across the Urals and the entire length of Asia to deliver a package to Genoq Biolabs in Singapore. You land on the buildings 80th floor setback, finding nobody there to greet you. When you enter the building, the main door snaps shut behind you, and you narrowly escape being killed by the building's security system.\n\nYou find the receptionist hiding behind her desk; she tells you that Genoq's head scientist Derrida, has been demanding the package you're carrying. His last panicked message came over an hour ago. This package is more important than you could have thought!\n\nYou realise that there is only one course of action, that you must take the package to Derrida, and if at all possible, rescue any survivors you find along the way.",

        "description": "Grab the Bottle is a quirky puzzle game in which you solve puzzles by stretching your arm through the level. \n\nYou need to maneuver an ever-extending arm to grab the goal bottle, avoiding anything hazardous on the way. To make things more tricky, Grab the Bottle brings physics and puzzles to the mix. You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. \n\nThe story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm.\n\nGrab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by \u201creal life problems\u201d on the way. Central element to the story is the specific craving for bottles the main character has.\n\nFeatures: - Innovative, twisted way of solving puzzles by stretching and retracting your arm - Story mode with dozens of levels set in locations ranging from attics to amusement parks, around 7 to 10 hours total - Awesome soundtrack featuring various styles of music, reflecting different life-phases of the main character",

The players compete to be the last robot standing. Using a charged burst of speed called the JOLT, and an array of different objects in the environment; your goal is to outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are down but not out through the use of the VOID, a random Sabotage Power-Up that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the race!\n\nKey Features: - JOLT \u2013 A charged burst of speed that can effect certain objects - VOID \u2013 Sabotage Power-Ups from post-elimination - Local Multiplayer racing, up to FOUR players - Chaotic, fast paced rounds - Skill and Timing based gameplay - Multiple Tracks - Multiple Game Modes - Create your own Robot\n\nThe JOLT is a player's primary utility to winning the race. It has 3 stages of charge, each one taking longer to store but each allowing you to shoot considerably further. If the player can time its use correctly; they can use it just before a curve to shoot up a wall or JOLT through an obstacle. Many short cuts in the levels are JOLT dependent.\n\nOnce eliminated, a player has the opportunity to execute the VOID. After punching in the correct sequence, the VOID player is gifted a random Power-Up to inflict mass-disruption to the existing racers.\n\nThe game features multiple Game Modes; Racer is the standard and most game modes are based off this, such as Light Mode (where the level is dark and the leading player has a light attached to them).",

        "description": "In the far distant future, a mysterious alien race set its sights on nothing less than the conquest of the Earth and the total annihilation of the human race. To counteract this threat the nations of Earth formed the EDC (Earth Defense Corps) and launched an all-out counter attack. Despite humanity's best efforts, the alien invaders superior technology proved too much to overcome and they took over most of the planet.  With enemy forces at the gates of the last fortress of the EDC and the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, the leaders of Earth's forces decide on a desperate course of action: throw everything they had left at the enemy's headquarters. With the help of the erratically brilliant \"Dr. AKEMI,\" the goal is no less than the destruction of the very heart of the alien stronghold.\n\nFeatures of Quad Fighter K include:\n\n- It's Dangerous to Go Alone The alien forces are an overwhelming force, but one you don't have to face alone. Bring along three friends and face the alien hordes with local co-op play!\n\n- It's not Retro, it's Timeless With 8-bit graphics and a focus on pure arcade shooting action, Quad Fighter K harkens back to the times when it was all about you (and perhaps a couple of friends), a quarter, and lightning-fast reflexes.\n\n- Quad Fighter Powers, ACTIVATE! Do your best work solo, or unleash real damage by linking your ship with a teammate to crush your foes and save the planet. Unlock different attacks by connecting your ship with your allies.\n\n- Should I Stay or Should I Go? Whether you're gaming at home or on the run, thanks to the mighty morphing powers of the Nintendo Switch\u2122, you can take out the alien hordes threatening our alternate Earth whenever, wherever.",

        "description": "Your father was brutally murdered before your eyes. Now you must train hard, eat chicken and punch dudes in the face to earn your place in the Punch Club ranks, and discover who ended your father's life.\n\nPunch Club is a boxing tycoon management game with multiple branching story lines. Your goal is clear, but how you get there depends on whether you want to legitimately climb the rankings, or take the more ridiculous, shady route.\n\nAlong the way you'll want to focus your talents. Will you take the Way of the Tiger, the Way of the Turtle, or the Way of the Bear? Your strength, accuracy and agility all depends on whichever Way enlightens your path. Do you have stripes, or flippers?\n\nAnd every decision will matter, especially in your social life. You'll be juggling friendships, love life, work, recreational time, relationships, and possible stardom, all alongside your gym time and fighting aligators. It's not all just pumping iron, you know.\n\n- Fighter management sim with RPG and tycoon elements - Find out who killed your father, and maybe learn something about yourself along the way - Heavily story-driven, with multiple different narrative branches and game endings to discover - Get as deep with stats as you like, and find your own way through extensive skill trees - Gorgeous pixel visuals with 80-90s references and nostalgia all over the place",

        "intro": "Now children can study division on the Nintendo Switch\u2122! Greco and his ghosts await in the greatest obstacle: The Calculation Castle! ",
        "description": "Finally, on the Nintendo Switch, a game that lets your child enjoy studying while challenging their skills in math has entered the world of gaming. It contains a collection of division problems and math drills learned at the elementary level. There are up to 10 steps of learning, starting from problems using times tables within Elementary 3rd year level range to developing skills such as calculating the remainders of 2-digit division problems and more. Advancing through the levels, your child can naturally become able to solve 3-digit by 2-digit division problems with ease.  The Story (setting) \u201cThe name\u2019s Greco. I\u2019m sendin you an invite to face the challenges that await in my castle! So, let\u2019s play a game!! I live at the very top of my castle! Do you got what it takes to reach me? It won\u2019t be easy. In order to get to me, you gotta pass through several rooms. In these rooms, you\u2019ll have to solve division problems to pass. That\u2019s why my castle is called the Calculation Castle! Moreover, my castle is full of ghosts with many tricks standing in your way, so good luck and do your best! If you manage to beat my ghostly henchmen and get through the rooms, you\u2019ll receive lots of hidden rewards\u2026but can you do it? I guess I\u2019ll wait and see! Heh heh heh\u2026\u201d  \u30fbThe game is composed of a series of stages and there are ghosts and locked doors within each stage. Greco and his ghosts will present the player with problems that they will need to solve in order to defeat the ghosts, unlock the doors, and proceed to the next stage. \u30fbThe player can face off against and defeat ghosts. Doing so will earn the player treasures(items) and ghost coins which can be used to reveal hints and unlock special bonus stages. \u30fbYour child can happily play while studying math and develop stronger skills regarding division after some time.  Learning System (Game Contents) [Select Problem]-----Players answer the questions by choosing the correct answer of the question from a series of numbers shown using cards. \u30fbChoosing the correct number will cause the ghost to take damage, reducing its HP(health points) by a set amount and earning the player some ghost coins. \u30fbIf the player reduces the ghosts HP to 0, the ghost will be defeated, and the player will receive items and ghost coins. \u30fbBy selecting and pushing [Hint] the player will be able to see a hint that can aid them in solving the question. Choosing to reveal a hint will require the player to spend ghost coins. [Unlock ]-----Remove the lock hung on the door by using the correct answer to the problem. \u30fbIf certain conditions are met and the numbers on the lock match with the numbers of problems solved correctly, then the lock will be removed. \u30fbIf all the locks on a door are removed then the door will open, and the player can advance further through the game. \u30fbBy selecting and pushing [Hint] the player will be able to see a hint that can aid them in solving the question. Choosing to reveal a hint will require the player to spend ghost coins. [Bonus Stage]-----By acquiring the required item or \u201ckey\u201d, the player can advance to a special bonus stage. \u00b7In this game mode, players must defeat as many ghosts as possible within the time limit. \u00b7When the player exterminates ghosts, they will receive ghost coins.  So, let\u2019s aim for the final stage where the decisive battle with Greco awaits! A game that lets your child enjoy learning and studying math is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Greco and his ghosts are waiting for the next challenger!\n\nWith Nintendo Parental Controls, you can utilize your smart phone to monitor your child\u2019s activities. For example, the feature can be used in such a way that for every hour your child spends playing a game, you can encourage them to play a study game, such as Greco\u2019s Calculation Castle, for 30 minutes. So, how about deciding the rules with your child?",

        "description": "Ever miss being a child, playing games at your grandma's or in your old bedroom? Then look no further! The Adventures of Elena Temple is the classic you never knew existed. And the best part is that you can play it on virtual old machines that kind of sort of maybe existed. It's not like you can remember for sure anyway, right?\n\nThe game is a monochromatic puzzle platformer made to look as if it were created in the 80s. Overcome obstacles, figure out how to collect all the coins, find all the gems and remember your childhood while doing it! Progress through the game's dungeon through non-linear exploration and keep an open eye for secrets to find. \u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005 Features: - A dungeon of 50+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level - Open exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful map is just one button press away - Challenging, old-school platforming - Collect as many coins as you want, but we both know you want them all - Coins will make you rich, but there's no escaping the dungeon without all the gems - Secret scrolls to find for the more observant player - Best of all, play the game on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, from the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the NS-Bos PC\n\nHeads up! The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on game content.\n\nI'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena Temple and I hope you enjoy it! Thank you for your support!",

This time we bring you The Mystery of the Hudson Case!\n\nIn 1979, a daring journalist sets out to investigate on his own, after continuous disapproval by his editorial department, the famous case of the Hudson Family, a family living in the vicinity of New New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. They lived in the time of British America, around the year 1830. They boasted an estate of four hectares where the rich landowner Mr. Benjamin Hudson owned a large number of slaves from the African continent, whom he tortured and raped in numerous occasions, provoking death. The case never reached the courts since Hudson enjoyed great freedom thanks to the contacts he had previously obtained in political office. Because of this, the journalist James O'Connell must travel to the state of Louisiana, where a difficult task awaits him if he intends to bring to light all the mysteries that may have been hidden for more than a hundred years in that mansion.\n\n\nWill you be able to solve the Hudson family\u2019s best kept secret?\n\nTry with this incredible Point and Click!\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Based on the Point and Click games - Great graphics that will immerse you in the story - Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve - An incredible soundtrack - Self-saved - HD graphics - All items tagged - NO hidden objects - Track book - Translated into: Spanish, English, Italian, French, Japanese",

        "description": "Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition is an award-winning and critically acclaimed visual short story that explores the emotional ties of family relationships.\n\nIn her mid-20s, Kelly has been forced to move back to Nebraska. Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out. She has to get home. In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' house, she receives a phone call from her mother.\n\nAssume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, players navigate an extended conversation between Kelly, her parents, and her younger brother. Through dialogue choice and simple driving mechanics, the story delves into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. \n\nThree Fourths Home: Extended Edition includes an epilogue that expands on the story of the main game. Set at a bus stop in snowy Minnesota, this epilogue examines Kelly's past as well as the effects that the events of the main story have had on her.",

Find cupcakes to unlock costumes and fill your scrap book up with secret stickers across five big, creative areas each with unique levels. Explore the mystical forests of Treevale, hike the haunted craters of the moon and dive into the depths of the ocean to find the lost city of Crablantis. \n\nIt's a mixture of lovingly handcrafted action-platforming levels, and RPG-like locations with townsfolk who provide quests, items and other goodies for you to buy to aid you on your journey. Just like your favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, The Adventure pals is both nutty and sweet,with perhaps just a little crunch. It's lighthearted, goofy fun no matter what your age.\n\nOh, and three words: Giraffe. Helicopter. Tongue.",

You better learn how to make cash fast and spend it smart in Streets of Red because when you're dead, your save data dies with you. The chills, thrills, bills, and opportunity to learn new skills here won't stop until every street runs red with blood! Are you up for the challenge of an anti-lifetime?",

Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. Although the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of destruction...\n\nAsdivine Hearts boasts of groundbreaking visual quality, plenty of subquests, a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to complete. By taking puzzle piece-like jewels and setting them in a box known as a rubix, players are able to customize characters! How far can you level and how many millions of damage can you dish out? All these challenges await you and more!",

        "description": "Super Daryl Deluxe is an RPGvania with brawler-style combat set inside of a perfectly normal, sprawling, multi-dimensional high school. Like any other perfectly normal school, its students and faculty are going missing and the classrooms have been locked down for weeks. Yes, there's nothing remarkable happening at WFHS whatsoever - just ask the new principal.\n\nThings are bound to get stirred up when an enthusiastic, bizarrely dressed new kid wanders into town. This go-getter's name is Daryl, and he just wants to make friends. What starts out as an innocent effort to help jump-start a young contraband textbook business turns into a harrowing quest through the school and its enormous, monster-filled classrooms in the hope of becoming the most popular kid in town. Oh - and saving everyone's lives is top priority, of course.\n\nNo need to worry. There's nothing to see here at Water Falls High School.",

Once vibrant lands are now littered with dust, rubble, concrete, and debris.\n\nMost creatures did not survive the Great Change. The survivors faired rather poorly in the immediate aftermath, becoming prey to all manner of predator. However, a lucky few managed to survive even then, to adapt, to thrive, to evolve. Zombillie was one such creature.\n\nZombillie lived a comfortable life in his humble cave, hunting for meat, and as he hunted, he grew, and grew, and grew. Everything was going relatively well for Zombillie, except for one problem: Zombillie didn't have enough meat!\n\nHelp Zombillie reach the legendary meat farm! A long road lies ahead: 90 complex levels full of puzzles and traps. So stand on your feet - all 100 of them - and just ride!\n\nFeatures - Almost 100 challenging levels - 3 completely different environments - Lots of power-ups & gadgets to find - Various levels - 2 additional types of mini-games - Addictive gameplay",

        "description": "Hours after receiving an urgent call in his Paris apartment, the protagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in London via his Jet-Pack, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical research facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist Jean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and seal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his problems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. All lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and furthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have run amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant warnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the item in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips Genoq. Over the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the courier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal bioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, which had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a front for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling biological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the company to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, and the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed D/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the building. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's corporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in order to prevent details of their activities from going public. Gameplay The main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected rooms (called \"scenes\" within the game), accomplishing various tasks within them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each level is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents a particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The game alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with many scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of things, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security systems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. Certain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of dangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue survivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely cleared of enemies. \n\nAs the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.\n\nAt the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to manipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into the game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other Trackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides with a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two examples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking before they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close doors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success in many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as other devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way as to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and pattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since tougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be performed quickly.",

Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets. \n\nOutlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you\u2019re right in the thick of it.\n\nYou are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. \n\nYou're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.",

        "description": "CASTLE OF HEART, available exclusively for Nintendo Switch\u2122, is a classic action platformer at the genre\u2019s best... and most challenging, with plentiful of new twists on formula to experience. The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by the evil sorcerer\u2019s spell, but ready to prove that love and courage can conquer even the darkest magic.\n\nThe brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village to the dark ruler\u2019s castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct environments \u2013 full of enemies who require different strategies to face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate to exciting, dynamic action sequences. The selection of progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will help him in his quest. But remember \u2013 the body of stone has its limits! It disintegrates permanently as the knight loses the energy, which he can supply only by defeating his enemies, and if the process reaches the critical level, he may lose one of his arms and the ability to wield additional weapons with it. \n\nCastle of Heart offers beautiful and detailed 3D graphics with changing landscape, weather conditions and rich backgrounds. The game\u2019s aesthetics and bestiary are in equal parts inspired by the Slavic mythology \u2013 with some locations derived straight from famous, mystical locations in Poland, the developers\u2019 home country \u2013 and the dark fantasy atmosphere of the best action platformer titles from the golden age of the genre. All of this makes Castle of Heart a perfect mix of classic influences and modern approach, utilizing the spectrum of Nintendo Switch\u2122 features, which will enchant both fans of the genre and newcomers.",

Mankind developed the system further, to create man-operated mechs and robots, known as GEARs.\n\nIn the year 2050, the world goes to war, in what would be known as World War IV. Nonetheless, the outcome, no one could have predicted...\n\nThe GEARs, which were the primary forces in battle became uncontrollable by their operators, and turned against mankind. GEARs that have gone berserk were named RAGEs, and left a mark on human history that can never be forgotten.\n\nIn 2097, the human population that remained was forced to live underground. And, in order to reclaim what they have lost to the RAGEs, they call upon the GEAR System once more.",

As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare",
        "description": "In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the \u201cresearch and charity\u201d branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy... until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.\n\nContinue to explore the dark world of the Murkoff Corporation with the included Outlast: Whistleblower DLC. You will play as Waylon Park, a software engineer under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed journalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of Outlast. Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he was unable to even talk to his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.\n\nOutlast: Bundle of Terror is a true survival horror experience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all come from the human mind. \n\nFeatures:\n\n- True Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to survive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or hide - Immersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying world to explore - Hide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired platforming elements - Unpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one of the asylum\u2019s terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them - Real Horror: Outlast\u2019s setting and characters are inspired by real asylums and cases of criminal insanity",

        "description": "PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.\n\nUp to four friends co-operate on each heist, and as the crew progresses the heists get bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming an infamous criminal comes new customization that lets players build and alter their guns and gear.\n\nPAYDAY 2 comes with full touch screen menu support, and a newly developed rumble feature that responds as you, for example, fire weapons or throw grenades. There\u2019s also an added local multiplayer mode to the CRIME.NET - called CRIME.NET Local Play, that will make you able to set up a local game and invite friends that share the same local network. Finally, PAYDAY 2 comes with an exclusive character called Joy who\u2019s initially releasing only on Nintendo Switch\u2122 - complete with her own mask and weapons.\n\n\u25a0 Rob Banks, Get Paid \u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.\n\n\u25a0 CRIME.NET \u2013 The dynamic contract database CRIME.NET lets players pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local Contractors - all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.\n\n\u25a0 Dynamic Scenarios \u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice, as heists come with random geometry and events.\n\n\u25a0 Choose Your Skills \u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master.\n\n\u25a0 More Masks than Ever \u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color.\n\n\u25a0 Weapons and Modifications \u2013 A huge arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper to assault rifles. You can modify your weapon with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and lots more.\n\n\u25a0 Play It Your Way \u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing.",

Something deep in my brain \u2013 deep in my very soul \u2013 clawed at me, struggling to make sense of everything. But the sad truth is that it never could. I never could. I still can\u2019t remember who I am.\u201d\n\nHello, prospective crew member! Welcome to Shakhter-One, the first space mining ship to gather resources from the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter! Shakhter-One provides mass quantities of supplies to a resource-starved Earth. Thanks to Shakhter-One, we no longer have to depend on coal or oil! Still not sold on making Shakhter-One your new home?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if this has happened before. Me, here, telling this same, exact story. \u2026Surely not. I would remember that\u2026 Right?\u201d\n\nShakhter-One offers a fresh start among the stars! On Shakhter-One, everybody is important! Everybody is employed! All children have an equal start! We\u2019re confident you\u2019ll see that Shakhter-One is the perfect place to begin your family\u2019s future!\n\n\u201cThe only thing that I can truly be sure of is the constant, pervading feeling I have deep inside. I\u2019m empty. I\u2019m hollow.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cHollow,\u201d you are one of the pilots that transports precious resource cargo from the mining ship Shakhter-One down to Earth. One day you wake up in an emergency capsule drifting near the facility. You don\u2019t remember who you are, or how you got out there\u2026 All you can remember is an autopilot docking code for capsule dock NR 6.\n\nWhen you dock with Shakhter-One, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong. The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship\u2019s terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 your life.\n\nThe worst evil is the one that knows us better than we know ourselves. The worst nightmare is the one borne in our past, emotions, fears, and pain.",

        "description": "The new TorqueL -Physics Modified Edition- has been released with updated physics following an update to the game engine, whilst still providing the same experience as the original TorqueL game.\n\nTorqueL is a curiously unique 2D rotation-action game, in which you proceed by rotating or extending a box with characters inside. Sometimes simply rotating or extending the box is not enough, and you have to find the right combination of rotatation and extension to jump or climb over obstacles.\n\nPlayers progress through the game by guiding the box towards the goal in each Chamber. Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which goals you reach, the game diverges into seven different paths.. There also exists a secret path that can only be unlocked under certain conditions. To clear each path you must reach the coloured goal that appears at the end. The seven basic paths and one secret path equal a total of fifty Chambers for you to brave.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany you as you play through the game. HD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",

Also, with cooperative play, experience an added challenge as the enemies you fight become tougher.\n\nVersus is the true test of friendship. Don't lose your focus by collecting power-ups in the map for instant abilities, elements, and maybe, a chance to survive. Versus comes with eight fully customisable rule sets, for quick scraps or longer fights. Go it alone in Free-For-All, or buddy up in Team Battles and share the victory. Add up to four AI players for true 5 player battles!\n\nFinally, in Onslaught, your enemies won\u2019t stop until you're defeated, so stand your ground. Survive long enough to unlock new maps.\n\nGood luck.",

With a cast of crazed characters, simple but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a pulsing musical score, ATOMIK: RunGunJumpGun is a loud, trippy mess of twitchy platforming goodness.\n\nThe two-button setup is disarmingly simple. One button shoots downwards, propelling you through the air. The other shoots forward, destroying anything that\u2019s in your path. There is no stopping in this beautifully surreal world littered with deadly traps and soul-crushing obstacles around every corner. Players will have to constantly alternate between the two firing modes to maneuver through meticulously crafted levels where death is a promise not a possibility. There is only running, gunning, jumping, and gunning, in a mad dash to survive long enough to die again. \n\nGame features: \u2022    Beautifully Difficult: Every second counts, and the game will test your reflexes to the fullest \u2022    Nonstop Action: Merciful respawns let you die fast and keep you constantly in the action \u2022    Two button gameplay: One button lets you fly, the other blasts obstacles into heaps of rubble. \u2022    Three Unique Game Worlds: Each world presents its own distinct challenges which require players to change their playstyles \u2022    Over 120 levels of Mayhem: Each level is meticulously crafted to hone and test the player\u2019s speed and tenacity. \u2022    Marathon Mode: For players looking to compete for the global high score. \u2022    Surreal visuals: Trippy and hyper-colourful fantasy-sci-fi art style \u2022    Hyperkinetic soundtrack: Pulsing musical score blending hip hop, electronic and movie-score vibes. \u2022    Warped space-opera narrative: The game features a cast of crazed, beautifully illustrated characters. \u2022    Masochistic Collectables: The quest to collect \u201cAtomiks\u201d littered throughout levels lends an extra level of insanity to already merciless level design. A gift to self-hating completionists. \u2022    Accessible single-hand gameplay: Appropriate for players with disabilities. \u2022    Made by free range developers fed a pure mixture of VVVVVV, Hotline Miami, and Super Meat Boy.",

You'll need them to face the increasingly hard enemies you'll find with over 30 different types (including 4 bosses).\n\nIn Tachyon Project you take control of Ada, a software program that has taken conscience and that was designed to hack into the most secure servers on Earth. After some rather misterious events, Ada is thrown out of the test server where it was living and out into the Internet, but when she tries to go back there she finds she's unable to. She'll then start a journey to uncover the truth behind what happened to her creators, which she considers her parents. In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought.",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They\u2019re not exactly what you and I would call \u201chuman friendly\u201d.\n\nUse the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.\n\nIf all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You\u2019re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!\n\nThat being said, welcome and good luck!",

Although this world can be lonely, she is kept company by her friend BOT. It advises her and encourages her to do the tasks she is assigned, although it knows much more than it lets on. In order to survive in this passive yet hostile environment, BOT will give Vesta a real helper \u2013 DROID. He may be a bit rough around the edges, but he'll handle physical tasks that would be impossible for a fully grown adult, let alone a little girl. Besides, he is the perfect weapon to defend against the dangers lurking in the remains of this abandoned complex. \n\nJoin Vesta as she explores various environments over 36 levels full of obstacles and enemy robots. She'll need her brains and DROID's power to traverse this varied landscape, properly manage the little energy left in the complex, solve the numerous puzzles she finds in her path, and even fight to survive. But most of all she will need to discover the truth of this story.",

Sacrificing his own well being to save his damsel in distress. Super Meat Boy brings the old school difficulty of classic titles and stream lines them down to the essential no BS straight forward twitch reflex platforming.\n\nRamping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing SMB will drag Meat boy though haunted hospitals, salt factories and even hell itself. And if 300+ single player levels weren't enough SMB also throws in epic boss fights, tons of unlockable secrets, warp zones and hidden characters.\n\nAnd now coming first to Nintendo Switch\u2122 is a brand new way to play Super Meat Boy with your friends. Introducing \"RACE MODE\"! In this 2 player split screen race, friends (or enemies) can compete against each other through individual chapters, randomized levels, or the entire game!

Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

One day, she wanders into a world called \"Tree of time\" with her nanny, Fairy.\n\nIt is said that there\u2019s a powerful treasure deep under the dungeon. In order to return back to their village through the power of the treasure, they decided to face the challenges of the dungeon!\n\nIf Rose is defeated during the adventure, she will lose all items and her level will be reset. And because the dungeon transforms every time you challenge it, the quests will never be the same. Your courage and growth will be the key to clear the dungeon!\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne choice, one victory: This game is turn-based. Both Rose and the enemies take turns moving. Players can think about what to do on their next turn. Wisdom and courage will bring you \u201csmall victories\u201d, and these will eventually bring you \u201chuge victories\u201d. \n\nThe \"Fang\" system: Rose can wear Fangs of monsters and gain their abilities. There are more than 200 kinds of monsters. You can seek the strongest combination and arrange your Fangs however you like.\n\nThe \"Brave\" system: Rose powers up when there are no obstacles around you within 8 squares. This overturns the \u201cbattling within the passage\u201d theory of the Roguelike game.\n\nThis game also has the Ranking function, Item Warehouse, Monster's Database, Achievement, Mini Puzzle, and Dungeon for Advanced Players.",

Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore. Heart&Slash offers players something new and challenging because it is not about mastering one system, rather adapting to what is provided and making the most of it.",

Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague.\n\nOn the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work.\n\nSome survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.",

Each world features unique situations, races, even bosses, and new permanent abilities to enhance Penelope's spaceship.\n\nWeapons can be mixed and used at any time, but all these abilities cost vital energy, so the player is very powerful and close to death at the same time!\n\nIf you've played a MicroMachines game, you'll feel right at home with the controls! (An alternative control scheme is available for newcomers as well.)\n\nSpecial bonus missions to extend your journey after beating the main game are available then battle with your friends as Penelope's suitors, who are battling each other for glory in a local 4 players mode!\n\nAlso, HD rumble support!",

        "description": "FRUITFALL CRUSH, a true puzzle game, ideally suited to the Nintendo Switch\u2122 gaming philosophy; simple in concept but with enormous depth as the challenge increases. FruitFall Crush is very easy to grasp with simple controls but will keep players coming back for more, eager to improve their performance. It\u2019s one of those games that\u2019s impossible to put down, yet so easy to pick up and play! The superb blend of carefully crafted game mechanics, ease of play combined with 75 mind bending levels, will have you reaching for FruitFall Crush time and time again!\n\nIT\u2019S A BRAIN GAME! The objective of the game is to make the fruit disappear by moving them around the grid until they are grouped together \u2013 fruit must be either above or to the left or right of another fruit, diagonals do not count. The fruit can be moved by rotating the play area and allowing the fruit to fall thereby creating groups of three or more of the same fruit, which will then be removed, a bonus is awarded if more than one group disappears on one turn. FruitFall Crush provides the player with 4 great Game Modes to enhance the playing experience to the full.\n\nARCADE MODE: In this mode you attempt to complete as many levels in a row accumulating your time and score as you proceed. If you run out of time or fail on any particular level, you are given three \u2018continues\u2019 - displayed as hearts at the top left of the screen. An Auto-solve help system avoids you becoming trapped and frustrated. Once you have \u2018unlocked\u2019 (completed) a level within Arcade mode, you are then allowed to access it within Time Trial or Practice modes.\n\nTIME TRIAL MODE: Finish the game as quickly as you can! You can try any \u2018unlocked\u2019 level as many times as you like, recording your best times along with your name for that level.\n\nPRACTICE MODE: Play the game at your own speed, no ticking clock to worry about and each time you restart, you continue where you got to last time.\n\nTWO PLAYER MODE: Go head-to-head with a friend in the exciting 2 player mode, using one Switch console either side by side in TV mode or competing end to end using a Joy-Con each to see who can finish 10 levels the quickest?!",

        "intro": "A new challenger has appeared in the platform fighter arena! Brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play, online matches and competitive tournaments. ",
        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale. Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for. \n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre\u2019s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you\u2019re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout. There are currently six original characters and two popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout\u2019s cast numbers 19 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that\u2019s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.\n\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you\u2019d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles: -\tAll on the same device -\tEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby -\tOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players AI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers.",

At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for te ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow. This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though-- the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn. Daniel finally discovers his goal: to kill Harnakon, the master of the castle, and free the Pure-Spirits who are trapped within. While the stage seems set for a typical role-playing adventure, Daniel will soon discover that everything is not what it seems...",

        "description": "\"THE LAST BLADE\" is a fighting game released by SNK in 1997, set in Japan\u2019s Edo period with a roster of unique swordsmen to choose from. Thematically the game is similar to the \u201cSAMURAI SHODOWN\" series, but also features a wealth of innovative systems to set it apart. One such system is the ability to choose between \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cSpeed\u201d styles when selecting a character. The \u201cPower\u201d system focuses on high damage while the \u201cSpeed\u201d system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique \u201cHajiki\u201d ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

        "description": "Teleport yourself into the most hardcore game this fall. Try to imagine a game simple in its basics, but demanding from the very first level, where everything might kill you. Even the camera and the main protagonist are against you as both of them constantly move forward. Add some barbed wire, spikes, and sawblades and you'll get Red Game Without a Great Name. And in this game you will die a lot.\n\nGameplay You control a mechanical bird that serves as a messenger in a hostile, steampunk world. To get the letter from one cage to another you have to maneuver the bird between all the obstacles. However, you don\u2019t directly control the main hero. The bird moves at its own pace, as does the camera. The trick is you can only order the bird to teleport from one point to another by clicking on it and dragging to mark its destination. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about frustrations though (not too much at least), you won\u2019t notice loading screens between the restarts, and the swinging music, as well as the one-more-try syndrome will keep you playing until you complete all of the 60 cleverly designed levels. There are three different power-ups to help you out in your mailman duties, but beware, they may work as double-edged swords if used without caution.\n\nKey Features - Simple to grasp, hard to master game mechanic \u2013 click & drag to teleport - 60 difficult levels - 180 gears to collect - 3 power-ups to enhance your abilities. - Unique art style dominated by red - One more attempt syndrome - Swinging music",

You will also get to fight giant bosses from time to time.\n\nBut there\u2019s no rush to keep the game in full swing at all times.

He got so upset he decided to leave home for good. Before he left, his mother gave him his grandfather's cane, some cheese and three pieces of gold. Hans walked into the forest in search of adventure. Soon it was night and the boy was really scared, so he tried to go back. But then, a quaint kobold happened to cross his path and Hans decided to follow him to a castle. The kobold told him he would inherit great wealth if he passed a simple trial... guessing his name. Trapped in the castle, Hans will live a spooky mystery, fantasy and horror adventure to become the new Count Lucanor.\n\nJoin Hans in a fantasy world and experience a unique adventure, full of surprises and challenges. Get hooked on an immersive tale, where every decision counts and every clue is a piece to solve the puzzle and get the treasure. Unravel the sordid secrets of the castle, meet colorful characters, and remember: horror always lurks beneath the surface.\n\n\nGameplay: \u2022 Exploration: Walk the Tenebre Castle and place candles on the ground to light up your path. \u2022 Conversation: Talk to NPCs to get important clues and unravel the mystery of the Count Lucanor. \u2022 Choices: Your actions change the course of story, with five different endings and several subplots. \u2022 Stealth: Hide under tables and behind curtains to go undetected. \u2022 Puzzles: Use the items you found wisely in order to progress. \u2022 Skill: Avoid traps and enemies in the castle by anticipating them.",

Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time.

You can even set up games with a mix of local and online players to fit your needs.

Suitable for rhythm game beginners and experienced players who need more of a challenge.\n\nMusic is created mostly by Taiwanese and Japanese composers, with a diverse selection of vocal and instrumental songs spanning a wide range of genres.\n\n[The Story] Deemo is a mysterious being who lives alone in a castle, playing the piano to itself. One day, a little girl with no memory falls from the sky, breaking his solitude.\n\nDeemo feels compelled to help her get home to her world. While looking for a way to return her to the sky, Deemo notices a small sapling which grows the more music is played. If Deemo is able to make it grow into a tree, tall enough so it would reach the window in the ceiling, she may just be able to get home.\n\nAs the two interact, Deemo learns what it means to have a friend. What awaits the two when the little girl regains her memory? This is a slightly strange, touching tale.",

Control both balls at exactly the same time as you try to avoid the death and danger that awaits their every move.\n\nOh, and there are jokes.(3) (1) May not be lovable (2) May not even be a word (3) May not be funny\n\nFEATURES * Make your way through over 100 levels of fiendish puzzle solving and death-defying challenges. * Glutton for punishment? Replay levels against the clock to get the fastest time you can. Are you quick enough to get S rank on every level? (We\u2019re not.) * A funky adaptive music score that ramps up when you do well and chills out if you\u2019re stuck, to help you concentrate. It\u2019s like the game wants you to do well (while it\u2019s throwing spikes at you). * Choose your own route to completion through a non-linear map. Stuck on a super-tough stage? No worries! Just go and hone your skills on a different level. * Laugh along with up to ten jokes! Look, we\u2019re going to keep saying it's funny. You'll come around eventually. (Don\u2019t worry there is no extra charge if you laugh more than ten times.)\n\n(No controllers were harmed in the making of this game.)",

Control Mario or Luigi in order to punch the enemies coming out of pipes from below to turn them over and then defeat them. In the two-player mode, both players can choose to work together or work against each other and enjoy the game in a myriad of ways.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

        "description": "Welcome to Thimbleweed Park. Population: 80 nutcases. \n\nA haunted hotel, an abandoned circus, a burnt-out pillow factory, a dead body pixelating under the bridge, toilets that run on vacuum tubes... you\u2019ve never visited a place like this before. \n\nFive people with nothing in common have been drawn to this rundown, forgotten town. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they are all deeply connected. And they\u2019re being watched.\n\n...Who is Agent Ray really working for and will she get what they want? ...What does Junior Agent Reyes know about a 20 year old factory fire that he\u2019s not saying? ...Will the ghost, Franklin, get to speak to his daughter again? ...Will Ransome the *Beeping* Clown ever become a decent human being? ...Will aspiring game developer Delores abandon her dreams and stick by her family? ...And most importantly: how come no one cares about that dead body?\n\nBy the end of a long, strange night in Thimbleweed Park, all of this will be answered -- and you\u2019ll question everything you thought you knew.\n\nIn a town like Thimbleweed Park, a dead body is the least of your problems.\n\nKey Features: - From Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, creators of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. - A neo-noir mystery set in 1987. - 5 playable characters who can work together... or get on each other\u2019s nerves. - Not a walking simulator! - Satisfying puzzles intertwined with a twisty-turny story that will stay with you. - A vast, bizarre world to explore at your own pace. - A joke every 2 minutes... guaranteed!* - Casual and Hard modes with varied difficulty. - English voices with English, German, French, Italian, Russian, and Spanish subtitles. *Not a guarantee.",

You'll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you but you'll have to figure out just how exactly they'll aide you in building and defending your Kingdom.\n\nKingdom: New Lands features: \u25cf One ruler, their horse, and a bag of coins \u25cf Greedy creatures trying to take your coins and crown every night (stop them!) \u25cf Loyal subjects who will help build, attack and defend your Kingdom \u25cf Multiple upgrades for your homestead, different unit types to attack and defend, and secrets littered throughout the land \u25cf Beautiful soundtrack that has received two honorable mentions from the Independent Games Festival\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.",

Manipulate gravity to redefine the ceiling as the floor while venturing through impossible architectures. Explore increasingly difficult worlds, each uniquely detailed and designed to leave you with a pronounced sense of intellectual accomplishment. The Bridge exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art in the style of a black-and-white lithograph.\n\nKey Features: * 48 thought-provoking puzzles, each unique from the rest, all requiring an innovative solution. * Gravity manipulations, gravitational vortexes, parallel dimensions, and many more mind-bending concepts in a world where the laws of physics are not what they seem. * M. C. Escher-esque worlds with impossible architecture set in the style of beautifully hand-drawn black-and-white lithographic art. * An alternate version of the game unlocked after the main storyline has been completed, including challenging alternate versions of each of the 24 main puzzles, along with an alternate ending. * A time-backtracking system to alleviate any fears of making a mistake.",

As an \"adept\" who possesses supernatural \"septimal powers,\" Gunvolt fights for the freedom of the nation from the tyrannical rule of the massive conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group and the invasion of a super-powerful group of adepts known as Eden.\n\nAzure Striker Gunvolt's deep storyline plays out both during breaks in the action and in the thick of battle too! Featuring a robust cast of characters that are fully voiced (in Japanese) and over 25 vocal tracks performed by characters in the game, the world of Gunvolt provides excitement at every turn.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch\u2122 version also features a slew of upgrades from the Nintendo 3DS\u2122 version, including a 60 FPS upgrade, upgraded UI, high-resolution event graphics, the entire DLC catalog from the Nintendo 3DS\u2122 version pre-loaded into the game, a brand new vocal track from the character Lumen, AKA \"The Muse\", HD Rumble compatibility, and more!",

They will battle it out among each other before taking on Shiro Tokisada Amakusa in the game\u2019s climax. One of the unique characteristics of this game is the Rage Gauge which fills up as the player takes damage. Once that gauge is full the character\u2019s attacks do more damage, keeping the battles tense and exciting.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

After customising a character with a variety of arms, the player holds one Joy-Con in each hand and throws left and right punches at the opponent. Characters can jump and dash, and players can bend their punches by twisting their hands as they swing. As players learn the game and improve their skills, they will discover a deeper level of advanced tactics. Players can compete against the computer, against a friend on a split screen using a second set of Joy-Con (sold separately), against worldwide rivals online, or with two Nintendo Switch consoles over a local wireless connection.",

The new Burst Combo system rewards you for finishing off enemies and bosses up close and personal, and the Dowsing ability triggers the HD rumble when you get close to one of the many hidden items/areas in the game.\n\nThe classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to blur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden age of 2D action games!",

Set in a fictional town named \"Lan Kong Town\", which is modeled after Yilan in Taiwan, the story is centered around 6 high school students who form a band that eventually achieves international fame. Gameplay is simple, requiring players to touch vertically falling notes that have hit a bar on the bottom of the screen. Depending on the song, the number of lanes for the notes increase and shift side to side, making the screen look as if it is dancing to the music. There are over 100 songs in the library. Three difficulty levels, \"Easy\", \"Hard\" and \"Special\" are available. Players are able to choose difficulty levels according to their skill so they may enjoy all pieces.",
