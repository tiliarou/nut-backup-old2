Thrilled to prove your worth as a knight, you track strange rumors that a mine vital to the Kingdom has been shut down. But what you discover in the mining town is worse than you imagined: The townspeople have disappeared, kidnapped by supernatural creatures emerging from the depths.\n\nHonor-bound to solve the mystery and restore peace to the Kingdom, you embark upon an epic adventure, with deadly battles against cunning monsters, exploration of ancient catacombs and castles, and powerful new equipment hidden at every turn. Though the overall story is the same for all players, your hero's journey will be unique: each of the rooms has been hand-designed, and behind the scenes Chasm stitches these rooms together into a one-of-a-kind world map that will be your own.",

        "description": "The two jello jelly creatures Bismo and Plom got connected in a tragic yet funny accident and thus can exchange their size and abilities at will. Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only game out there which doesn't take a closer look at the body mass index and where players are actually forced to work together (and occasionally stab each other in the back).\n\nExperience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds: \u25cf\tExplore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident! \u25cf\t Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests... \u25cf\t... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026 \u25cf\t... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves!\n\nThe twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability.\n\nThe game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content. Although the game is primarily meant to be played by two people, you can play the completely different singleplayer levels without another person.\n\nThe game features all the good things you should expect from a co-op platformer:\n\n\u25cf\tOver 40 levels of handcrafted fun \u25cf\tLocal co-op gameplay \u25cf\tExtra challenges/rewards in the levels for completionists and explorers \u25cf\tMore than 30 different levels designed for the singleplayer mode \u25cf\t8 unlockable bonuslevels (4 single- & 4 multiplayer) \u25cf\tAnd timechallenges for each level",

Nothing and no one are safe in this once-peaceful city. You're the new sheriff in town and must restore law and order by taking out these renegade chickens.\n\nIn each of the three levels, the aim is to hunt as many chickens and collect as many points as possible in just 90 seconds.

You have to find that out for yourself!\n\nLevel 1: On the prairie The first level takes place on the prairie. There's a torture stake, boxes, bottles, a prison and a bench. If you shoot off the prison's lock, a robber chicken will come out and try to rob the bank. To get to the next level, you have to reach at least 350 points, shoot the torture stake and ...\n\nLevel 2: In the Canyon In the second level, you are in front of GUN CITY, which can already be seen in the background. You\u2019ll also see a fisherman in his boat next to a tent, a farmer next to a crate of potatoes and a gold-seeker on his claim. To reach the next level, you have to reach at least 350 points, spruce up the canyon a little bit and ...\n\nLevel 3: In GUN CITY In the city, there are many buildings, a gallows and many chickens. Destroying the buildings\u2019 windows makes enemies appear. There are lots of surprises in this level, so you\u2019d better get moving in order to find all those hidden points.\n\nOTHER FEATURES: \u2022 Joy-Con\u2122 Speed \u2014 Choose one of three speed settings for maximum hunting success.\n\n\u2022 Rankings \u2014 Beat your own top scores over and over again and compete against friends and players around the world for the top position in the rankings.\n\n\u2022 Fairness \u2014 There are rankings for each level for touch players and rankings for players who play exclusively with the Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller.\n\n\u2022 Tutorial and FAQs \u2014 Tips and tricks to quickly become a respected sheriff.\n\n\u2022 Online/Offline \u2014 Play whenever and wherever you like.

It\u2019s just another wonderful day out with the kids in Think of the Children, a frantic parenting simulator for up to four players. \n\nHauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering the lives of your children, the Prosecutors present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a day at the zoo, a camping trip, an unexpected visit to the Australian Outback and more. Each of these locations proves to be far more dangerous than they sound, and even the tamest of environments are filled with deadly hazards. \n\nRun solo, or team up with other parents to play through each trip in flashback to prove your parenting skills-and your innocence-to the judge, and avoid going to jail. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nMulti-tasking mayhem: There\u2019s never a dull moment when you\u2019ve got the BBQ to tend, picnic tables to set, some of the kids are playing with a rabid dog, and two of them just ran out onto the road.\n\nParenting is hard: To get a good parenting grade and avoid jail time you\u2019ll need to get all your tasks done, keep the kids happy, and\u2013ideally\u2013alive!\n\nNowhere is safe: The local park, the beach, the supermarket, the zoo. Great places for a day out with the kids. That is, aside from the poisonous berries, ravenous seagulls, towering grocery shelves and electrified pens.\n\nAll kinds of families welcome: Single parent? Two mums? A mum, two dads and a horse in a long distance relationship? It\u2019s all good. Parent solo or co-operatively with up to four players.",

Multiplayer allows either game mode, while single-player focuses entirely on real-time strategic gameplay.\n\nThe objective of each battle is to destroy the opponent\u2019s keep. To reach an enemy\u2019s keep, players must launch what is essentially the seed of a new structure, which will sprout into a new building upon landing and erect a wall connecting the new tower to the building that launched it. Each structure boasts its own capabilities, such as constructing other specific buildings, or spawning particular units. \n\nPlayers can decide to either quickly attack an opponent\u2019s base, adopt a more defensive strategy by fortifying their own headquarters or maintain a balance of offence and defence. Strategies are influenced by which of the two sides in the conflict players select.",

        "description": "Cities: Skylines is a modern take on a classic city builder. With original gameplay to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city. Boasting fully realized transport and economy systems, Cities: Skylines is designed to suit any play style - and now, anytime, anywhere.\n\nMore portable than ever, the new Nintendo Switch\u2122 edition of this best-selling city builder comes complete with reworked UI, designed especially for Nintendo Switch\u2122, along with two of Cities: Skylines\u2019 most popular expansions - After Dark and Snowfall. \n\nMulti-tiered and challenging simulation: Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor, you\u2019ll be faced with balancing essential requirements like education, healthcare and much more along with your city\u2019s real economy system. Citizens in your city react fluidly, with gravitas and an air of authenticity to a multitude of gameplay scenarios.\n\nNintendo Switch\u2122 Edition exclusive: Using HD Rumble, a rumble effect helps find the most efficient area to place service buildings in your city. Pro controllers are also supported, and additional tutorials help guide your first playthrough for a better learning experience.\n\nExtensive local traffic simulation: Colossal Order\u2019s extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is put to work in fully fleshed out, well-crafted transport systems.\n\nDistricts and Policies: Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city.\n\nAfter Dark: Focused on leisure and tourist specialization, this expansion\u2019s central feature is to utilize the day and night cycle and alter the approach to managing your city. Will you construct a bustling city that lives and breathes at night, or succumb to the perils and misadventures of the dark hours? \n\nSnowfall: The difficulty heats up when the city cools down, thanks to this expansion\u2019s added challenges and assets, like snow maps, streetcars, and heating systems. There are in-game temperature readings, cosmetic weather enhancements, extra parks, and infrastructural demands to keep your citizens warm and safe from freezing conditions.",

        "description": "With an art style inspired by the 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s, FullBlast is a vertical-scrolling shooter that will bring a dose of nostalgia to all gamers who spent many an hour at their local arcade, engaging in Shmups. But don\u2019t worry, just because it\u2019s retro in origin, modern conventions and technology have been considered, resulting in a modern and vibrant presentation that is the perfect way to introduce a new generation of gamers to a largely untapped genre.\n\nTry to take in as much as you can, when you have the time though. Being a shmup, it\u2019s not just an alien menace you have to worry about, but their projectiles you\u2019ll need to dodge if you hope to survive! Across the game\u2019s 12 random levels, humanity is on the verge of extinction due to an alien invasion and it just so happens, you're the last hope to save the world. So, get ready to take flight and let loose, because those aliens are not going to shoot themselves. Humanity\u2019s retaliation starts here!\n\nFeatures:  * Story campaign of 12 levels * 2 player local co-op mode * 4 Mini bosses and 3 Mega bosses * 3 Difficulty levels * Mission system and leaderboards * Gorgeous 3D graphics * Power-ups and power-downs (be careful of what you pick!!) * Heavy metal sound track",

        "description": "While seeking life on a distant planet, an astronaut discovers an abandoned Russian town. He suspects his mission is a hoax until a mysterious young woman saves him from a strange and deadly phenomenon.\n\nAfter a hard landing on the planet, the astronaut discovers the planet that was reported to be rich with life is instead a barren wasteland. When he goes searching for his crew, he makes a more startling discovery: evidence that humans have already been to this planet years ago! When he comes upon a deserted Soviet-era Russian town, he struggles to make sense of his mission. Did his light-speed travel to the planet send him back in time? Or is this all some strange Cold War hoax?\n\nEquipped with a limited-use jet-pack and a mobile robotic arm, the player must use wits and skill to solve puzzles, unravel the mystery, and survive the Lifeless Planet!",

With four distinct environments with unique enemies, the challenge is always evolving. Multiple modes such as Rogue-like and Arena, and unlockable outfits with unique bonuses, will keep you coming back for more. Fear not the rogue-like though; with the Pussycat mode you can play the game with checkpoints in every level, in a classic linear adventure. This will not make it much easier though, fast reflexes and a keen eye are required in order to survive the journey to free your Master. You don't have to take this journey alone though; you can have a group of up to four people in local co-op!\n\nClaws of Furry can be played using one or two joy-con controllers for single and multiplayer! Connect more controllers to support up to 4 players!",

        "description": "In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.\n\nEventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.\n\nKey Features - Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. - 3 game modes: Normal for quick games, Endless for stress-free play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge. - 20 real-world cities to design subways for. Each has a unique colour theme and set of obstacles. - Supports up to 4 players. Build with your friends and argue over the best design. - Trains! Did we mention them yet?",

Now Steve and his expanding roster of dubious heroes must wield their unique skills to shoot, slide, dive, and take cover behind a political platform built on ethics, accountability, and an inordinate amount of gunfire. Eliminate the criminal underworld of the city\u2019s three major districts and persuade undecided voters to your cause, tackling the issues that matter by putting a gun in the mouth of those issues. \n\nThrough the power of ISO-Slant\u2122 technology and a wasted youth, London-based developer Roll7 (OlliOlli) delivers the greatest 2\u00bcD cover-based indie shooter of all-time, ever.\n\nNext Level Shootouts \u2013 Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts. The intuitive quick-snap cover system lets you slide, roll, and dive into cover, dodging enemy fire before fighting back with tackles, executions, and 100s of bullets.\n\nRoster of Not Heroes - Select between 9 different heroes, each with their own distinct gameplay style and crime murdering abilities. Blast the city\u2019s scum through doors with Cletus\u2019 a shotgun, slice them in half with Kimmy\u2019s katana dash, or simply bash crime in it\u2019s terrible face with Ronald\u2019s hammer.\n\nDynamic Missions \u2013 Go ham on primary objectives and (sometimes random) secondary goals but be prepared for unexpected mid-level events that turn the tables on the anti-heroes in an instant. SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and victory.",

Enter, our three unlikely protagonists: the dragon, Sash Lilac, who unwittingly gets involved when she witnesses a strange airship crash-land and grows concerned for the well-being of its pilot; the wildcat, Carol Tea, whose dedication to her best friend leads her to undertake whatever challenges fate throws her way; and the orphaned puppy, Milla Basset, whose quest for nothing more than mere companionship inadvertently brings her directly into the line of fire. Together, this trio of anthropomorphized heroines must somehow ingratiate themselves to each of the three houses, stop an all-out alien invasion, and learn the secret nature of the Kingdom Stone before its power wanes\u2026and before a world war breaks out around them.  Freedom Planet is a fast-paced combat-driven platform adventure that pits a spunky dragon girl and her friends against hostile foreign powers and alien attack forces. There's trouble around every turn, from insects to giant robots to sheer explosive destruction, but players will have a variety of special fighting abilities at their disposal to blast through more than a dozen massive, nonlinear stages. The campaign may be played through as Lilac, Carol, or the unlockable Milla, each of whom has completely unique gameplay mechanics, an altered story mode in which the selected character takes the lead, and even a few of her own unique stages.  KEY FEATURES  Gorgeous 2D pixel art with meticulous detail and a grand, rocking soundtrack Lush multi-scrolling backdrops are layered behind minutely detailed stages, each populated with a variety of lovingly animated characters and most backed by at least two unique music tracks per stage, along with unique music for almost every boss battle.  Three playable characters with completely different strengths and abilities Use Lilac\u2019s dragon powers to hair-whip enemies, spin like a cyclone, or blaze through the skies like a comet; use Carol\u2019s feline agility to cut through foes with punches and kicks, scale walls, or summon a gravity-defying motorcycle; and use Milla\u2019s mighty basset-hound ears to fly short distances, or call upon her canine magic to create deadly cubes which can be tossed at foes, compressed into a directional shield, or fired off as if from a rifle.  Momentum-based platforming and combat in a wide variety of settings Use the game\u2019s tight controls to reach incredible speeds and heights, exploring massive stages full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden collectibles. Send enemies flying, fight screen-filling bosses, dodge lasers, ride mine carts, hop from airship to airship, and more!  Follow the story, or just play the game; it\u2019s all up to you Play in \u201cAdventure Mode\u201d to enjoy the game\u2019s intense and dramatic story, with over an hour of unique cutscenes and full voice-acting, or pick \u201cClassic Mode\u201d to do away with cutscenes entirely and simply play the stages for a streamlined gameplay experience.",

        "description": "You play a bipedal frog employed by the mysterious start-up company 'Cat & Frog Inc.'. Fend off enemies seeking to stop you and overcome the challenging landscape as you head towards your destination.\n\nWhen you start the game, you'll likely be surprised by your paltry amount of life and your dodgy weapon. And when the frog runs out of life, he 'enters hospital' and has to restart from the beginning of the stage. But you can keep collecting and saving up money to go 'shopping' to increase your life and carefully select powered-up weapons to take down enemies you couldn't defeat before. The further you get, the stronger you can feel yourself becoming - and it feels good.\n\nThe characters appearing in between stages are the game's other charm point. You'll meet your co-worker, who is a cat (for some reason), your president (also a cat), and an office lady of indeterminate species. They work like us, slog through overtime like us, whinge, get berated, and even comfort each other, just like us.\n\nExperience the unique and intricately detailed world of Kero Blaster!",

Only the most skilled and strategic players will defeat the Trial of the Gods.\n\nYou are a Faceless One: a one-armed, gun-wielding assassin of legend. The seven deities of Polygod will test your skill with randomly generated arenas of hostile minions, followed by a boss fight against a ruthless Holy Champion.\n\nEach of the arenas features five Altars of Worship, offering you Blessings in exchange for Souls you have collected along your journey. Blessings combine and stack to create unique gun effects, but each has consequences, so choose wisely if you wish to survive each wicked challenge. And don\u2019t forget, death is permanent in this purgatory of the gods!\n\nThe art style is inspired by the meta-physical surrealist artist Giorgio de Chirico who is famously revered for his eerie mood and strange artificiality of cityscapes.\n\nMain Features: A unique, randomly generated experience every time. Randomise the levels, blessings offered and enemy placement with our seed system, or challenge others on specific seeds!\n\nGun customisation with 100 unique blessings. Each seed will offer you a different selection of blessings as you progress through the levels. Strategically combine and stack them to fit your personal playstyle. Ever wondered what it would be like if your bullets were bubbles? Well, what if they were bubbles AND proximity mines? And you shot 3 of them at once? AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT? The options are endless! Do you choose a lethal sniper build, or a bullet wall of death? How will you survive: lifesteal, jump-strafe dodging, tank-like health? How do you want to navigate the environment: double jump, helicopter boots, teleportation?\n\nAdditional Features: Splitscreen co-op Gyroscope aiming supported 35 unique enemies 15 unlockable playable characters 7 epic boss fights against Holy Champions 7 even harder Red Holy Champions Special Boss Blessings Experimental soundtrack Minimalist, colourful artstyle Quirky NPCs",

Governments and companies promise remedies through technological progress. Drones and humanoid robots replace humans in the public sector, everything is interconnected, surveillance has become omnipresent.\n\nRichard Nolan is one of the few journalists openly criticizing this development. When he wakes up in hospital after an explosion and finds that his wife and son have mysteriously vanished, Richard realizes: he and his family have become more than just bystanders in a storm of rivaling ideas pertaining humankind\u2019s salvation between dystopian reality and digital utopia. Instead, they find themselves right at the center of it.\n\nThis domestic drama evolves into a thriller about a worldwide conspiracy, which at its core aims to determine the fate of humanity: Could a perfect digital utopia be the answer? A virtual paradise not affected by material needs and quarrels? Could a super-AI be our savior \u2013 or would it simply declare us as dispensable since it could not be taught the value of philanthropy?\n\nWhat will the world look like after this storm, what will remain of humanity?\n\n\u00b7 Experience an alarmingly realistic vision of the near future \u00b7 Dive into a multi-layered Sci-Fi thriller, where dystopian reality and digital utopia are intertwined \u00b7 Unravel a global conspiracy in a society of ubiquitous digitalism, surveillance and transhumanism \u00b7 Explore a world with a rich and unique visual style, combining realistic environments with low-poly characters \u00b7 Take on the role of journalist Richard Nolan, as well as five additional playable characters \u00b7 Use dexterity, deductional skill and research to reconstruct Richard's past",

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you\u2019ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air...",

There is also original cheesy synth music and constant taunts from his master, the Evil Overlord (he just wants all the blingy loot).\n\nAn extra feature is a choice of game mode for a variety of challenges and gameplay options. There is a practice mode for those who wish to jump straight into any room in the Bling Palace (requires room name, all are fixed and can be swopped freely, no unlocks/keys required). And there are harder modes for those who think extra lives are for wimps. The hardest mode is only for the brave: Dougie has one life and no extra lives can be added to it.\n\nBe a clever, brave monkey and gather the master's loot but don't step in the vomit.",

In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert. He has been petrified for three years, though. With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he\u2019s actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the handle - and who Robert loves, with a capital L. Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.",

Without it, you'd fail even harder. - Epic Storyline: Not included. Instead, be guided by floor texts that make fun of you when you fail and drop awful puns even if you unexpectedly don't. - Scavenger Hunt: Discover secret areas that lead to other secret areas which in turn lead to other secret areas. You get the idea, and maybe even the rainbow that awaits you at the end of the treasure. Probably you'll just google it though. - Speedrolling: Replay levels in Rush mode as fast as you can and prove that you are a good person by beating other players' highscores. - Style your Balls: Be rewarded with awesome bonus contents like tasty new colors and trail effects for your balls.",

You went to visit the concert hall where the lower note echoes rhythmically with vibration. Tonight, the one playing music is the Visual-Kei band \u201cFOX EAR\u201d. All 5 unique members are wearing a fox ear. Once you hear their voices, the magatama (comma-shaped beads) that you have on your neck beams out the light. This dazzling light made me lose my consciousness and taken back to \u201cFOX EAR\u201d \u2019s dressing room. As they pressure you to give them the magatama, but as magatama seems out the light again as if to protect you... Although the 5 members noticed that they can\u2019t take it by force, they tried to make you fall for them to get magatama\u2015\u2015.\n\n- Characters Ak!to(\u6681\u4ec1) / CV : Mamoru Miyano (\u5bae\u91ce\u771f\u5b88) KASUM!

Simple but intense, laugh-out-loud fun.\n\nUNIQUE GAMEPLAY SESSIONS Randomly generated levels, 70+ unique magitech weapons, 43 enemy types and 3 bosses will give you a different gameplay experience every time.

In certain areas of the game, you'll\u00a0find small tests that you can take. If you pass them, you win a reward. The decision to accept the challenge or not depends solely on you!\n\n- In the virtual store, you can get or buy all of the many weapons with specific uses for each adverse situation. There are two types: consumables and others that come\u00a0loaded and never run out.\n\n- Replayability with various challenges to overcome.\n\n- Big, difficult-to-defeat bosses.\n\n- Dark, desolate and extremely hostile environments.\n\n- A style of Metroidvania gameplay and a Rogue-like philosophy.\n\n- Get the infinite jet pack and experience new sensations.\n\n- As a Rogue-like game, you have two options when starting a new game, you choose:\n\n   * With a new seed you will have a different generation of the game.\n\n   * With the same seed, you will have an identical game situation.\n\n- Don\u2019t miss out on this adventure as it will continue on with future chapters in new conspiracies. \u00a0 ",

        "description": "Semblance is a innovative platformer with deformable terrain, set in a beautiful minimalist world. It\u2019s a game that asks, what if you could deform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a \u2018platform\u2019 in a platformer and turns it on it\u2019s head. What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems? Explore a world where the default is soft, where the property of 'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay: Can\u2019t reach a collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and push-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.\n\n\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design: Explore 3 worlds bursting with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become hypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.\n\nExplore non-linearly: The game allows you to move between puzzles as you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.",

You already know that sinking eight balls is the ultimate goal, but can you succeed while contending with monster balls chasing you, or ballerina balls leaping away from your well-aimed shots?\n\nTake on the role of the mischievous, and dare we say, oblivious cue ball in Pool Panic's unique world comprised of 100+ levels while enjoying the single-player campaign, or invite your friends to join you for a multiplayer panic.\n\nFeatures: -Single player campaign includes a large world with over 100 levels that span music festivals, mines, diners, the wild west, caverns, farms, and more! -Local multiplayer for up to four players. Multiple control modes supported, including two players on a single Nintendo Switch\u2122, using a single Joy-Con\u2122 per player. -Panic Mode pits your pool skills against the clock, but don't forget that all the other balls are just as animated and alive as you, so different balls react differently to hits! -Discover the unique characteristics of dozens of different balls and the strategies required to pot them, even as they use their unique skills to try and thwart your efforts. -Fight a swamp monster, light up a derelict lighthouse, battle a biker gang, puke on a pirate ship, flee zombieballs after raising the dead, foil a bank heist, even joust! Seriously, you can ride a horse ball and joust. -Express yourself! White cue balls such as yourself can use a little pizzazz, so enjoy trying on the 80+ different hats you're able to steal from other balls in the game.",

        "description": "\"Ghost\" is a metroidvania where two super hackers hire a mysterious agent in order to infiltrate the Nakamura Space Station and steal the greatest electronic secret ever. Of course, the space station will defend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, with their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to be destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find out about their agent's hidden ties...\n\nWEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No need to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body.\n\nUPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are.\n\nITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls.\n\nGEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.\n\nSECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special.\n\nMAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss.\n\nSTORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English.\n\nGAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die.\n\nSKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way.\n\nAnd the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just have to discover the rest on your own.",

Red Hot Ricochet is an intense game of ricochet duels, and you'll need wise shooting, lucky bounces, and a bit of triggernometry to win.\n\nEach player is armed with a gun that shoots bouncing bullets, allowing you to ricochet your shots based on your ammo count. You'll use the rocks around you both as cover and a way to hit your opponents where they least expect it. When you're not giving your enemies a lethal dose of lead, you can also use your bullets to grab powerups, revive dead allies, or gain a burst of speed. Use your ammo wisely, or you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot (literally).\n\nYou can't all make it out of this desert alive, so make sure the bullets bounce your way. Find the best rocks, envision the tastiest angles, and pull the fastest trigger - or someone else will.",

Can you survive all 8 matches? * Versus: Play local matches with friends or the CPU, and get competitive with hidden cursors for double-blind character select at the touch of a button. * Career: Take part in fictional fighting game tournaments around the globe, playing against AIs based on some of Pocket Rumble's top players and eventually facing off against AIs from some familiar faces in the FGC. * Lessons: Robust tutorials that teach you the very basics of how fighting games work * Training: A fully-featured training mode with a variety of hotkeys and options including viewable hitboxes, save states, dummy recording and more.\n\nOnline Modes: * Ranked: Get matched up with players of your skill level online, earn points and rank up with Elo ratings, leaderboards including character-specific rankings, and a rematch button to challenge someone to an unranked set when you need that runback. * Unranked: Invite your friends to play unranked matches just for fun!",

        "description": "PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK At the end of the 1800s the government declared a global ban on this legendary card game due to an increase in bar fights, divorces, and family feuds. It was political correctness gone mad.\n\nAwkward is the ultimate test on finding out how well friends, couples, and family know each other. Players are asked to answer increasingly uncomfortable questions in secret, while their companions try to guess the outcome. \n\nHEATED CLASSICS! Pineapple on pizza, yay or nay? RELATIONSHIP CHOICES! What part of your partner do you prefer, body or face? HORRIBLE DILEMMAS! If you could only save the life of one, would you choose a 1-year-old or an 18-year-old?\n\nWhether you deduce correctly or incorrectly, games of Awkward help players see each other in a brand new light. And your opinion counts: each Awkward question will let you compare your vote to the rest of the world. Banned for over 120-years, Awkward is back, and you can now enjoy this controversial adult card game as a videogame.\n\nQUALITY GAMEPLAY Featuring the original banned questions, as well as all new content written by Danny Gallagher (Quiplash, Fibbage 2) and Joanna Haslam (Buzz! Quiz World, It's Quiz Time). One to six players can join in, with a huge selection of game modes on offer. Play cooperatively, as teams, competitively, or solo players can play alone to guess how the rest of the world fared with Awkward's controversial questions.\n\nAwkward is the ultimate party game featuring over 5,000 fiendish questions. Do you dare to find out how well you really know each other?",

        "description": "Dream Alone is a 2D platforming game with classic platform gameplay, deadly traps, a dark storyline and unique hero abilities. \n\nA mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels including a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. \n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! \n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.\n\nFEATURES: - Unique gameplay due to alternative reality levels and time warp feature - Varied game mechanics - Grayscale graphic with original \u201cold horror\u201d camera effects - Enigmatic story reminiscent of dark fairy tales - Beautiful minimal soundtrack - 21 levels full of disturbing story",

An HD remaster of the original game, LUMINES REMASTERED beautifully marries the elements of sound, light and puzzle-action into one addictive, yet easy-to-play game. \n\nYou\u2019re at the center of the high-energy, block-dropping action while you groove to awesome house, trance and techno beats! Play LUMINES REMASTERED on-the-go in handheld mode or at home in TV mode and tabletop mode. \n\nFeel the sound: Play over 40 skins with electronic atmospheres from chill to upbeat. Shuffle skins (like a music playlist) as more are unlocked in a new Shuffle mode.\n\nFeel the challenge: Faster tempos means less time to make combos, but slower songs can mean uncleared stacks. You\u2019ll get hooked.\n\nFeel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.\n\nFeel the vibration: Turn on Trance Vibration and sync up to four Joy-Con\u2122 controllers to feel the bass across your body.",

We fear that the workers trapped in our Singapore lab have little chance of survival. Those of you familiar with the Neogen organisms produced in this lab would agree that any rescue attempt would be a suicide mission. The remaining survivors are beyond hope.\n\nPrior to the outbreak, our recon satellites spotted an explosion near the top of the building. This is where Derrida, our head scientist, is creating the next Neogen prototype, the D/Generation.\n\nThe D/Generation represents an extremely advanced stage of artificial evolution. Equipped with sophisticated neuro-holographic camouflaging, it can disguise itself as anything. It also has a super-hardened dermal layer that acts like a sheet of armour, malting it virtually indestructible.\n\nWe are now forced to accept the unthinkable, that the D/Generation is loose in the building. But this might only be the beginning. If it were to escape from the labs out into the real world, the D/Generation would threaten every person on this planet...\n\nYour Objective\n\nAlone with your jetpack, you have flown from Finland across the Urals and the entire length of Asia to deliver a package to Genoq Biolabs in Singapore. You land on the buildings 80th floor setback, finding nobody there to greet you. When you enter the building, the main door snaps shut behind you, and you narrowly escape being killed by the building's security system.\n\nYou find the receptionist hiding behind her desk; she tells you that Genoq's head scientist Derrida, has been demanding the package you're carrying. His last panicked message came over an hour ago. This package is more important than you could have thought!\n\nYou realise that there is only one course of action, that you must take the package to Derrida, and if at all possible, rescue any survivors you find along the way.",

        "description": "Grab the Bottle is a quirky puzzle game in which you solve puzzles by stretching your arm through the level. \n\nYou need to maneuver an ever-extending arm to grab the goal bottle, avoiding anything hazardous on the way. To make things more tricky, Grab the Bottle brings physics and puzzles to the mix. You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. \n\nThe story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm.\n\nGrab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by \u201creal life problems\u201d on the way. Central element to the story is the specific craving for bottles the main character has.\n\nFeatures: - Innovative, twisted way of solving puzzles by stretching and retracting your arm - Story mode with dozens of levels set in locations ranging from attics to amusement parks, around 7 to 10 hours total - Awesome soundtrack featuring various styles of music, reflecting different life-phases of the main character",

It's time for you to keep things quiet and tidy. Take on the role of the chicken hunter as you move the screen left and right to search for more chickens and power-ups. Then use your bullets to shoot incoming birds. The harder they are to get, the more points they are worth.\n\nMoorhuhn is a great way to kill a few minutes or pass the time for a couple hours and challenge other players worldwide.\n\nSpecially designed for Nintendo Switch, Moorhuhn Remake gives you the choice to play alone or in real time against a friend or in turns with up to four players.\n\nSelect the game mode you like most: \u2022 Single-player \u2014 You have 90 seconds to hunt as many chickens and collect as many points as possible. Beat your personal record and compete with players around the world.\n\n\u2022 1 vs. 1 duel \u2014 The goal is to hunt more chickens than a friend in only 90 seconds!

Using a charged burst of speed called the JOLT, and an array of different objects in the environment; your goal is to outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are down but not out through the use of the VOID, a random Sabotage Power-Up that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the race!\n\nKey Features: - JOLT \u2013 A charged burst of speed that can effect certain objects - VOID \u2013 Sabotage Power-Ups from post-elimination - Local Multiplayer racing, up to FOUR players - Chaotic, fast paced rounds - Skill and Timing based gameplay - Multiple Tracks - Multiple Game Modes - Create your own Robot\n\nThe JOLT is a player's primary utility to winning the race. It has 3 stages of charge, each one taking longer to store but each allowing you to shoot considerably further. If the player can time its use correctly; they can use it just before a curve to shoot up a wall or JOLT through an obstacle. Many short cuts in the levels are JOLT dependent.\n\nOnce eliminated, a player has the opportunity to execute the VOID. After punching in the correct sequence, the VOID player is gifted a random Power-Up to inflict mass-disruption to the existing racers.\n\nThe game features multiple Game Modes; Racer is the standard and most game modes are based off this, such as Light Mode (where the level is dark and the leading player has a light attached to them).",

To counteract this threat the nations of Earth formed the EDC (Earth Defense Corps) and launched an all-out counter attack. Despite humanity's best efforts, the alien invaders superior technology proved too much to overcome and they took over most of the planet.  With enemy forces at the gates of the last fortress of the EDC and the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, the leaders of Earth's forces decide on a desperate course of action: throw everything they had left at the enemy's headquarters. With the help of the erratically brilliant \"Dr. AKEMI,\" the goal is no less than the destruction of the very heart of the alien stronghold.\n\nFeatures of Quad Fighter K include:\n\n- It's Dangerous to Go Alone The alien forces are an overwhelming force, but one you don't have to face alone. Bring along three friends and face the alien hordes with local co-op play!\n\n- It's not Retro, it's Timeless With 8-bit graphics and a focus on pure arcade shooting action, Quad Fighter K harkens back to the times when it was all about you (and perhaps a couple of friends), a quarter, and lightning-fast reflexes.\n\n- Quad Fighter Powers, ACTIVATE! Do your best work solo, or unleash real damage by linking your ship with a teammate to crush your foes and save the planet. Unlock different attacks by connecting your ship with your allies.\n\n- Should I Stay or Should I Go? Whether you're gaming at home or on the run, thanks to the mighty morphing powers of the Nintendo Switch\u2122, you can take out the alien hordes threatening our alternate Earth whenever, wherever.",

But like so many times before, the trail went cold...\n\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway.

        "description": "Your father was brutally murdered before your eyes. Now you must train hard, eat chicken and punch dudes in the face to earn your place in the Punch Club ranks, and discover who ended your father's life.\n\nPunch Club is a boxing tycoon management game with multiple branching story lines. Your goal is clear, but how you get there depends on whether you want to legitimately climb the rankings, or take the more ridiculous, shady route.\n\nAlong the way you'll want to focus your talents. Will you take the Way of the Tiger, the Way of the Turtle, or the Way of the Bear? Your strength, accuracy and agility all depends on whichever Way enlightens your path. Do you have stripes, or flippers?\n\nAnd every decision will matter, especially in your social life. You'll be juggling friendships, love life, work, recreational time, relationships, and possible stardom, all alongside your gym time and fighting aligators. It's not all just pumping iron, you know.\n\n- Fighter management sim with RPG and tycoon elements - Find out who killed your father, and maybe learn something about yourself along the way - Heavily story-driven, with multiple different narrative branches and game endings to discover - Get as deep with stats as you like, and find your own way through extensive skill trees - Gorgeous pixel visuals with 80-90s references and nostalgia all over the place",

        "description": "Ever miss being a child, playing games at your grandma's or in your old bedroom? Then look no further! The Adventures of Elena Temple is the classic you never knew existed. And the best part is that you can play it on virtual old machines that kind of sort of maybe existed. It's not like you can remember for sure anyway, right?\n\nThe game is a monochromatic puzzle platformer made to look as if it were created in the 80s. Overcome obstacles, figure out how to collect all the coins, find all the gems and remember your childhood while doing it! Progress through the game's dungeon through non-linear exploration and keep an open eye for secrets to find. \u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005\u2005 Features: - A dungeon of 50+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level - Open exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful map is just one button press away - Challenging, old-school platforming - Collect as many coins as you want, but we both know you want them all - Coins will make you rich, but there's no escaping the dungeon without all the gems - Secret scrolls to find for the more observant player - Best of all, play the game on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, from the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the NS-Bos PC\n\nHeads up! The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on game content.\n\nI'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena Temple and I hope you enjoy it! Thank you for your support!",

This time we bring you The Mystery of the Hudson Case!\n\nIn 1979, a daring journalist sets out to investigate on his own, after continuous disapproval by his editorial department, the famous case of the Hudson Family, a family living in the vicinity of New New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. They lived in the time of British America, around the year 1830. They boasted an estate of four hectares where the rich landowner Mr. Benjamin Hudson owned a large number of slaves from the African continent, whom he tortured and raped in numerous occasions, provoking death. The case never reached the courts since Hudson enjoyed great freedom thanks to the contacts he had previously obtained in political office. Because of this, the journalist James O'Connell must travel to the state of Louisiana, where a difficult task awaits him if he intends to bring to light all the mysteries that may have been hidden for more than a hundred years in that mansion.\n\n\nWill you be able to solve the Hudson family\u2019s best kept secret?\n\nTry with this incredible Point and Click!\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Based on the Point and Click games - Great graphics that will immerse you in the story - Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve - An incredible soundtrack - Self-saved - HD graphics - All items tagged - NO hidden objects - Track book - Translated into: Spanish, English, Italian, French, Japanese",

        "description": "Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition is an award-winning and critically acclaimed visual short story that explores the emotional ties of family relationships.\n\nIn her mid-20s, Kelly has been forced to move back to Nebraska. Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out. She has to get home. In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' house, she receives a phone call from her mother.\n\nAssume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, players navigate an extended conversation between Kelly, her parents, and her younger brother. Through dialogue choice and simple driving mechanics, the story delves into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. \n\nThree Fourths Home: Extended Edition includes an epilogue that expands on the story of the main game. Set at a bus stop in snowy Minnesota, this epilogue examines Kelly's past as well as the effects that the events of the main story have had on her.",

Each character changes up the way you play, meaning there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had in battling through the campaign with each warrior. \n\nNinja \u2013 This deadly fighter has a Spinning Slash attack and \u2018Storm Attack\u2019 special. Kunoichi \u2013 She carries plenty of threat and should not be underestimated, with a Spinning Shot attack and \u2018Kunai\u2019 special. Chain Sickle \u2013 This mysterious fighter\u2019s unique style gives him incredible range, with a Chain Attack and \u2018Sickle Slash\u2019 special.

Boost and fight your way through for the highest combos, with maximum rankings of three stars per stage reserved for the most skilled of players.\n\nAre you up for the challenge in Ninja Striker?",

Level up to learn special abilities, throw bombs and whack things with your sword. Find cupcakes to unlock costumes and fill your scrap book up with secret stickers across five big, creative areas each with unique levels. Explore the mystical forests of Treevale, hike the haunted craters of the moon and dive into the depths of the ocean to find the lost city of Crablantis. \n\nIt's a mixture of lovingly handcrafted action-platforming levels, and RPG-like locations with townsfolk who provide quests, items and other goodies for you to buy to aid you on your journey. Just like your favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, The Adventure pals is both nutty and sweet,with perhaps just a little crunch. It's lighthearted, goofy fun no matter what your age.\n\nOh, and three words: Giraffe. Helicopter. Tongue.",

On his path, he will witness many beautiful landscapes of the scenery and will acquire many trustworthy allies, all of which will also enrich his stories that will be worthy of telling about... That is, of course, if you'll be able to help him survive and triumph over the evil.\n\nFeatures: - Compeling and philosophical storyline - Unsual visual presentation of the game, inspired by the ZX Spectrum - Classic arcade gameplay - Diffirent genre entries, for example, \"shoot 'em up\" genre will make it's way into the game, at a certain point.",

Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. Although the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of destruction...\n\nAsdivine Hearts boasts of groundbreaking visual quality, plenty of subquests, a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to complete. By taking puzzle piece-like jewels and setting them in a box known as a rubix, players are able to customize characters! How far can you level and how many millions of damage can you dish out? All these challenges await you and more!",

        "description": "Hours after receiving an urgent call in his Paris apartment, the protagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in London via his Jet-Pack, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical research facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist Jean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and seal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his problems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. All lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and furthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have run amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant warnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the item in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips Genoq. Over the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the courier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal bioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, which had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a front for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling biological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the company to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, and the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed D/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the building. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's corporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in order to prevent details of their activities from going public. Gameplay The main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected rooms (called \"scenes\" within the game), accomplishing various tasks within them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each level is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents a particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The game alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with many scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of things, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security systems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. Certain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of dangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue survivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely cleared of enemies. \n\nAs the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.\n\nAt the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to manipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into the game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other Trackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides with a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two examples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking before they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close doors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success in many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as other devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way as to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and pattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since tougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be performed quickly. ",

        "description": "Outlast 2 is the sequel to the acclaimed survival horror game Outlast. Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets. \n\nOutlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you\u2019re right in the thick of it.\n\nYou are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. \n\nYou're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.",

        "description": "CASTLE OF HEART, available exclusively for Nintendo Switch\u2122, is a classic action platformer at the genre\u2019s best... and most challenging, with plentiful of new twists on formula to experience. The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by the evil sorcerer\u2019s spell, but ready to prove that love and courage can conquer even the darkest magic.\n\nThe brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village to the dark ruler\u2019s castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct environments \u2013 full of enemies who require different strategies to face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate to exciting, dynamic action sequences. The selection of progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will help him in his quest. But remember \u2013 the body of stone has its limits! It disintegrates permanently as the knight loses the energy, which he can supply only by defeating his enemies, and if the process reaches the critical level, he may lose one of his arms and the ability to wield additional weapons with it. \n\nCastle of Heart offers beautiful and detailed 3D graphics with changing landscape, weather conditions and rich backgrounds. The game\u2019s aesthetics and bestiary are in equal parts inspired by the Slavic mythology \u2013 with some locations derived straight from famous, mystical locations in Poland, the developers\u2019 home country \u2013 and the dark fantasy atmosphere of the best action platformer titles from the golden age of the genre. All of this makes Castle of Heart a perfect mix of classic influences and modern approach, utilizing the spectrum of Nintendo Switch\u2122 features, which will enchant both fans of the genre and newcomers.",

Spy Chameleon is an arcade-puzzle game where the player must avoid being seen thanks to the chameleon's ability to change colors and camouflage.  Through 5 missions and 75 levels, the player will discover different enemies and abilities to complete these super-secret missions: taking photos of a celebrity with her lover and stealing the secret formula of a successful soft drink are just two examples.  Watch your enemies, choose the best path and run to the next safe point. The duration of each level can mean finishing a game in just minutes or spending hours trying to complete the missions and all the challenges, getting the best time among your friends or completing all the achievements.  Game features: - change colors to camouflage yourself with your surroundings - 75 levels where the difficulty increases as you learn new mechanics - 3 challenges in each level: gather collectables and beat a time - playability that combines reflexes, synchronization and strategy (at 60 FPS in 1080p) - compare your best times with those of your friends or the whole world",

You can experiment with them and play the ones that best suite your driving style and the different situations you'll find in our 12 tracks.

Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for you to tinkle and play with, but most importantly this game has been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either alone or with friends.",

Mankind developed the system further, to create man-operated mechs and robots, known as GEARs.\n\nIn the year 2050, the world goes to war, in what would be known as World War IV. Nonetheless, the outcome, no one could have predicted...\n\nThe GEARs, which were the primary forces in battle became uncontrollable by their operators, and turned against mankind. GEARs that have gone berserk were named RAGEs, and left a mark on human history that can never be forgotten.\n\nIn 2097, the human population that remained was forced to live underground. And, in order to reclaim what they have lost to the RAGEs, they call upon the GEAR System once more. ",

As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare",
        "description": "In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the \u201cresearch and charity\u201d branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy\u2026 until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.\n\nContinue to explore the dark world of the Murkoff Corporation with the included Outlast: Whistleblower DLC. You will play as Waylon Park, a software engineer under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed journalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of Outlast. Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he was unable to even talk to his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.\n\nOutlast: Bundle of Terror is a true survival horror experience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all come from the human mind. \n\nFeatures:\n\n- True Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to survive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or hide - Immersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying world to explore - Hide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired platforming elements - Unpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one of the asylum\u2019s terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them - Real Horror: Outlast\u2019s setting and characters are inspired by real asylums and cases of criminal insanity ",

        "description": "PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.\n\nUp to four friends co-operate on each heist, and as the crew progresses the heists get bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming an infamous criminal comes new customization that lets players build and alter their guns and gear.\n\nPAYDAY 2 comes with full touch screen menu support, and a newly developed rumble feature that responds as you, for example, fire weapons or throw grenades. There\u2019s also an added local multiplayer mode to the CRIME.NET - called CRIME.NET Local Play, that will make you able to set up a local game and invite friends that share the same local network. Finally, PAYDAY 2 comes with an exclusive character called Joy who\u2019s initially releasing only on Nintendo Switch\u2122 - complete with her own mask and weapons.\n\n\u25a0 Rob Banks, Get Paid \u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.\n\n\u25a0 CRIME.NET \u2013 The dynamic contract database CRIME.NET lets players pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local Contractors - all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.\n\n\u25a0 Dynamic Scenarios \u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice, as heists come with random geometry and events.\n\n\u25a0 Choose Your Skills \u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master.\n\n\u25a0 More Masks than Ever \u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color.\n\n\u25a0 Weapons and Modifications \u2013 A huge arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper to assault rifles. You can modify your weapon with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and lots more.\n\n\u25a0 Play It Your Way \u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing.",

Sometimes simply rotating or extending the box is not enough, and you have to find the right combination of rotating and extending to jump or climb over obstacles.\n\nPlayers progress through the game by guiding the box towards the goal in each Chamber. Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which goals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There also exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain conditions. To clear each route you must reach the coloured goal that appears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a total of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany you as you play through the game. HD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",

With a cast of crazed characters, simple but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a pulsing musical score, ATOMIK: RunGunJumpGun is a loud, trippy mess of twitchy platforming goodness.\n\nThe two-button setup is disarmingly simple. One button shoots downwards, propelling you through the air. The other shoots forward, destroying anything that\u2019s in your path. There is no stopping in this beautifully surreal world littered with deadly traps and soul-crushing obstacles around every corner. Players will have to constantly alternate between the two firing modes to maneuver through meticulously crafted levels where death is a promise not a possibility. There is only running, gunning, jumping, and gunning, in a mad dash to survive long enough to die again. \n\nGame features: \u2022    Beautifully Difficult: Every second counts, and the game will test your reflexes to the fullest \u2022    Nonstop Action: Merciful respawns let you die fast and keep you constantly in the action \u2022    Two button gameplay: One button lets you fly, the other blasts obstacles into heaps of rubble. \u2022    Three Unique Game Worlds: Each world presents its own distinct challenges which require players to change their playstyles \u2022    Over 120 levels of Mayhem: Each level is meticulously crafted to hone and test the player\u2019s speed and tenacity. \u2022    Marathon Mode: For players looking to compete for the global high score. \u2022    Surreal visuals: Trippy and hyper-colourful fantasy-sci-fi art style \u2022    Hyperkinetic soundtrack: Pulsing musical score blending hip hop, electronic and movie-score vibes. \u2022    Warped space-opera narrative: The game features a cast of crazed, beautifully illustrated characters. \u2022    Masochistic Collectables: The quest to collect \u201cAtomiks\u201d littered throughout levels lends an extra level of insanity to already merciless level design. A gift to self-hating completionists. \u2022    Accessible single-hand gameplay: Appropriate for players with disabilities. \u2022    Made by free range developers fed a pure mixture of VVVVVV, Hotline Miami, and Super Meat Boy.

        "description": "In the wake of political developments during the summer of 2016 Britain found itself increasingly isolated from global society. Frustrated by the demise of this once great nation Her Majesty the Queen concluded that the elected representatives at Westminster were no longer fit to govern her United Kingdom. Establishing S.P.I.F.F.I.N.G. (Special Planetary Investigative Force For Inhabiting New Galaxies) Her Majesty has turned to the stars in a bid to establish a new, Galactic British Empire! Assuming command of the near futuristic space ship HMSS Imperialise and her crew (distinguished veteran and gentleman Captain Frank Lee English and Aled, his mild-mannered South Walean colleague) YOU will venture into the cosmos, solving puzzles, engaging in witty banter, deal with crippling claustrophobia, gradually succumb to the sustained exposure of cosmic radiation and so on, all for Queen and Country.",

Through the story mode you'll progressively unlock all the weapons, secondary weapons and perks available to configure your ship. You'll need them to face the increasingly hard enemies you'll find with over 30 different types (including 4 bosses).\n\nIn Tachyon Project you take control of Ada, a software program that has taken conscience and that was designed to hack into the most secure servers on Earth. After some rather misterious events, Ada is thrown out of the test server where it was living and out into the Internet, but when she tries to go back there she finds she's unable to. She'll then start a journey to uncover the truth behind what happened to her creators, which she considers her parents. In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought.",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They\u2019re not exactly what you and I would call \u201chuman friendly\u201d.\n\nUse the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.\n\nIf all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You\u2019re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!\n\nThat being said, welcome and good luck!",

This is the game that parts lovers, destroys families and turns friends into enemies. And it does even more! And I have proof! You can spread affront to everyone in the world that has Internet access or - if you\u2019re not the most sociable - you can sit alone and play with yourself. Nudge nudge. \n\nSo don\u2019t let the parrot die for nothing and tell that grumpy old lady that her husband donated organs for a strange woman lying in a pond and that her sister poses nude for some dog. Then meet a retired hipster who admires pictures of a grunting sow, and a fake Russian who borrowed a dead body to put his teacup and crumpets on. It\u2019s also the only game that lets you learn what\u2019s The Meaning of Life, and that\u2019s scientifically proven!\n\nGame Features: - Loner\u2019s Insult Tournament Mode: Battle your way through numerous unique situations and verbally assault your CPU - Real-Life Friends Mode: Dual against your actual friends on a couch, ottoman, or whatever else you like to rest your fanny on - Imaginary-Friends Mode: Verbally take down strangers from all over the world online - 11 Hilarious Playable Characters: Each with their own unique voices, quirky traits and hilarious \u201cinsult bits\u201d - 4 Conflict Scenarios: Lay down some verbal jujitsu across 4 different testy situations and dynamic environments - Contentious Battle System: Employ combos, criticals, continuations and other new mechanics to outwit your argumentative opponents!

Super Meat Boy brings the old school difficulty of classic titles and stream lines them down to the essential no BS straight forward twitch reflex platforming.\n\nRamping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing SMB will drag Meat boy though haunted hospitals, salt factories and even hell itself. And if 300+ single player levels weren't enough SMB also throws in epic boss fights, tons of unlockable secrets, warp zones and hidden characters.\n\nAnd now coming first to Nintendo Switch\u2122 is a brand new way to play Super Meat Boy with your friends. Introducing \"RACE MODE\"! In this 2 player split screen race, friends (or enemies) can compete against each other through individual chapters, randomized levels, or the entire game!

Twelve fighters compete to be crowned as the strongest one in the \u201cKing of Fighters\u201d ultimate fighting championship.  New mechanics such as the revamped \u201cRage Guage\u201d, the addition of both weak and strong attacks, and a landing recovery mechanic mean that battles are even more intense than in the previous title!.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.

Players choose from one of the six monsters available, and battle their way across Japan in order to claim the title of strongest monster. In addition to normal attacks such as punches and kicks, master more destructive techniques such as flame and beam attacks to overcome the enemies.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

One day, she wanders into a world called \"Tree of time\" with her nanny, Fairy.\n\nIt is said that there\u2019s a powerful treasure deep under the dungeon. In order to return back to their village through the power of the treasure, they decided to face the challenges of the dungeon!\n\nIf Rose is defeated during the adventure, she will lose all items and her level will be reset. And because the dungeon transforms every time you challenge it, the quests will never be the same. Your courage and growth will be the key to clear the dungeon!\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne choice, one victory: This game is turn-based. Both Rose and the enemies take turns moving. Players can think about what to do on their next turn. Wisdom and courage will bring you \u201csmall victories\u201d, and these will eventually bring you \u201chuge victories\u201d. \n\nThe \"Fang\" system: Rose can wear Fangs of monsters and gain their abilities. There are more than 200 kinds of monsters. You can seek the strongest combination and arrange your Fangs however you like.\n\nThe \"Brave\" system: Rose powers up when there are no obstacles around you within 8 squares. This overturns the \u201cbattling within the passage\u201d theory of the Roguelike game.\n\nThis game also has the Ranking function, Item Warehouse, Monster's Database, Achievement, Mini Puzzle, and Dungeon for Advanced Players.",

        "description": "Set around a city being consumed from within by a disease, Plague Road tells a story of a lone doctor who once abandoned their home and now returns to learn the fate of those they left behind. Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague.\n\nOn the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work.\n\nSome survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.",

The objective of the game is to make the fruit disappear by moving them around the grid until they are grouped together \u2013 fruit must be either above or to the left or right of another fruit, diagonals do not count. The fruit can be moved by rotating the play area and allowing the fruit to fall thereby creating groups of three or more of the same fruit, which will then be removed, a bonus is awarded if more than one group disappears on one turn. FruitFall Crush provides the player with 4 great Game Modes to enhance the playing experience to the full.\n\nARCADE MODE: In this mode you attempt to complete as many levels in a row accumulating your time and score as you proceed. If you run out of time or fail on any particular level, you are given three \u2018continues\u2019 - displayed as hearts at the top left of the screen. An Auto-solve help system avoids you becoming trapped and frustrated. Once you have \u2018unlocked\u2019 (completed) a level within Arcade mode, you are then allowed to access it within Time Trial or Practice modes.\n\nTIME TRIAL MODE: Finish the game as quickly as you can! You can try any \u2018unlocked\u2019 level as many times as you like, recording your best times along with your name for that level.\n\nPRACTICE MODE: Play the game at your own speed, no ticking clock to worry about and each time you restart, you continue where you got to last time.\n\nTWO PLAYER MODE: Go head-to-head with a friend in the exciting 2 player mode, using one Switch console either side by side in TV mode or competing end to end using a Joy-Con each to see who can finish 10 levels the quickest?!

        "intro": "A new challenger has appeared in the platform fighter arena! Brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play, online matches and competitive tournaments. ",
        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale. Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for. \n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre\u2019s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you\u2019re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout. There are currently six original characters and two popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout\u2019s cast numbers 18 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that\u2019s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.\n\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you\u2019d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles: -\tAll on the same device -\tEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby -\tOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players AI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers.",

Select a hero [or team up in co-op] and battle your way to the bottom of the Gungeon by surviving a challenging and evolving series of floors filled with the dangerously adorable Gundead and fearsome Gungeon bosses armed to the teeth. Gather precious loot, discover hidden secrets, and chat with opportunistic merchants and shopkeepers to purchase powerful items to gain an edge.\n\nThe Gungeon: Enter the Gungeon \u2013 a constantly evolving bullet hell fortress that elegantly blends meticulously hand-designed rooms within a procedurally-generated labyrinth bent on destroying all that enter its walls. But beware \u2013 the Gungeon responds to even the most modest victory against its sentries and traps by raising the stakes and the challenges found within! \n\nThe Cult of the Gundead: The Gungeon isn\u2019t just traps and chasms \u2013 calm your nerves and steady your aim as you face down the gun-totting Cult of the Gundead. These disciples of the gun will stop at nothing to put down the heroes in their tracks and employ any tactics necessary to defend their temple.\n\nThe Gungeoneers: Choose between one of several unlikely heroes, each burdened by a deep regret and in search of a way to change their past, no matter the cost. Filled with equal parts courage and desperation, these adventurers won\u2019t hesitate to dive across flaming walls, roll through a wall of bullets, or take cover behind whatever is around to make it to their goal alive!\n\nThe Guns: Discover and unlock scores of uniquely fantastic guns to annihilate all that oppose you in the Gungeon \u2013 each carrying their own unique tactics and ammunition. Unleash everything from the tried and true medley of missiles, lasers, and cannonballs to the bizarrely effective volley of rainbows, fish, foam darts, and bees! Yep, bees.",

At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for te ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow. This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though-- the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn. Daniel finally discovers his goal: to kill Harnakon, the master of the castle, and free the Pure-Spirits who are trapped within. While the stage seems set for a typical role-playing adventure, Daniel will soon discover that everything is not what it seems...",

        "description": "\"THE LAST BLADE\" is a fighting game released by SNK in 1997, set in Japan\u2019s Edo period with a roster of unique swordsmen to choose from. Thematically the game is similar to the \u201cSAMURAI SHODOWN\" series, but also features a wealth of innovative systems to set it apart. One such system is the ability to choose between \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cSpeed\u201d styles when selecting a character. The \u201cPower\u201d system focuses on high damage while the \u201cSpeed\u201d system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique \u201cHajiki\u201d ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\u3000",

Start stacking tiles and tap on them to attack monsters!\n\nYou won't be able to stop playing! Play whenever you want, as much as you want.\n\n= How to play = Stack three or more connected sword tiles by tapping and holding one of the tiles. The more tiles you stack together, the stronger your attack power! By tapping on a tile of three or more swords, you can attack and defeat the monsters! Monsters of the Greek myths will appear one after the other. Try to defeat them!\n\n= Add gods to your party! = You may find a variety of Greek gods in treasure chests that can be found in the game once in while! They can be your allies. Use the gods' abilities and win against all the monsters that will appear in front of you.\n\n= Features = Easy but profound game development. A puzzle system you have never experienced before. Many cool gods and monsters designed by HEY. Beautiful but minimal graphic design and animation.",

Even the camera and the main protagonist are against you as both of them constantly move forward. Add some barbed wire, spikes, and sawblades and you'll get Red Game Without a Great Name. And in this game you will die a lot.\n\nGameplay You control a mechanical bird that serves as a messenger in a hostile, steampunk world. To get the letter from one cage to another you have to maneuver the bird between all the obstacles. However, you don\u2019t directly control the main hero. The bird moves at its own pace, as does the camera. The trick is you can only order the bird to teleport from one point to another by clicking on it and dragging to mark its destination. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about frustrations though (not too much at least), you won\u2019t notice loading screens between the restarts, and the swinging music, as well as the one-more-try syndrome will keep you playing until you complete all of the 60 cleverly designed levels. There are three different power-ups to help you out in your mailman duties, but beware, they may work as double-edged swords if used without caution.\n\nKey Features - Simple to grasp, hard to master game mechanic \u2013 click & drag to teleport - 60 difficult levels - 180 gears to collect - 3 power-ups to enhance your abilities. - Unique art style dominated by red - One more attempt syndrome - Swinging music",

Use this power to help a mechanical bird complete its extremely important mission of collecting the knowledge about a mysterious green world. This is not an easy task, as the bird moves on its own, and you cannot stop it. Control time to activate and deactivate various mechanisms, to make sure the bird reaches the cage without dying.\n\nThe game features fifty carefully designed levels. You will need to make your way through a hostile world - the blades of windmills will slice the bird, pistons shall squash it and spiked gates are going to crush it. Control time to deactivate traps and activate the steam generators that will change your movement direction. Find one of many ways to the end of each level. Plan your route and show your reflex skills to get through the most difficult paths and gather all the gears.\n\nGame Features: - 50 levels full of dangers - controlling time and thus influencing the environment - many different paths to the destination - a unique green graphical style - soul jazz soundtrack - power-ups (immortality, slow flight, etc.). - 150 gears to collect - one-more-try-and-I-quit syndrome",

Explore Felingard's huge overworld map, risk life and limb delving into dungeons for epic loot, and lend a paw to a furry cast of characters in a flurry of side quests.\n\n- Combat in Cat Quest takes place entirely in real time, allowing you to get close to enemies with a slash of your blade, dodge roll to avoid a counter-attack, and then finish them off with powerful magic! Wield the ancient spells of Lightnyan, Flamepurr, and Healpaw to vanquish your foes! (Fur real!)\n\n- Outfit your catventurer with a whole basket of equipment! Prefurr casting spells? Don an arcane hood, robes, and a staff to bolster your mana reserves! Want to protect yourself from attack? Deck out your catventurer with chainmail armor to increase your health and provide an extra level of protection. Weapons, armor, and spells can be mixed and matched to create the purrfect combinations for your playstyle!\n\n- The world of Felingard is littered with interesting places and people! Discover a possessed town whose residents lust for obscene amounts of meat, assist the mages Mewlin and Meowgan in their search to break a magic seal, and locate someone's missing delivery of \"House of Parchments\" and \"The Pouncing Dead\". Exploration is one of the main scratching posts of Cat Quest, and with locations such as Bermewda's Triangle, the Furbidden Fields, and Pawt City to explore, it's time to get pawing!",

        "description": "\"Deemo\" is a simple rhythm game set in a fantasy world filled with beautiful imagery.\n\nTouch the \"notes\" that stream toward the screen in time with the music. The system is easy to understand, and players are able to enjoy gameplay which resembles playing a piano.\n\nThere are over 200 pieces of music to choose from, with difficulty levels of EASY, NORMAL, and HARD. Suitable for rhythm game beginners and experienced players who need more of a challenge.\n\nMusic is created mostly by Taiwanese and Japanese composers, with a diverse selection of vocal and instrumental songs spanning a wide range of genres.\n\n[The Story] Deemo is a mysterious being who lives alone in a castle, playing the piano to itself. One day, a little girl with no memory falls from the sky, breaking his solitude.\n\nDeemo feels compelled to help her get home to her world. While looking for a way to return her to the sky, Deemo notices a small sapling which grows the more music is played. If Deemo is able to make it grow into a tree, tall enough so it would reach the window in the ceiling, she may just be able to get home.\n\nAs the two interact, Deemo learns what it means to have a friend. What awaits the two when the little girl regains her memory? This is a slightly strange, touching tale.",

Control both balls at exactly the same time as you try to avoid the death and danger that awaits their every move.\n\nOh, and there are jokes.(3) (1) May not be lovable (2) May not even be a word (3) May not be funny\n\nFEATURES * Make your way through over 100 levels of fiendish puzzle solving and death-defying challenges. * Glutton for punishment? Replay levels against the clock to get the fastest time you can. Are you quick enough to get S rank on every level? (We\u2019re not.) * A funky adaptive music score that ramps up when you do well and chills out if you\u2019re stuck, to help you concentrate. It\u2019s like the game wants you to do well (while it\u2019s throwing spikes at you). * Choose your own route to completion through a non-linear map. Stuck on a super-tough stage? No worries! Just go and hone your skills on a different level. * Laugh along with up to ten jokes! Look, we\u2019re going to keep saying it's funny. You'll come around eventually. (Don\u2019t worry there is no extra charge if you laugh more than ten times.)\n\n(No controllers were harmed in the making of this game.)",

Upgrade your skills, find new competencies, switch your Aegis in real time in order to get rid of Nightmare's invasion: \"Fight for the safety of your land, dear Dreamkeeper\".\n\nTold in the manner of a fable read to a child, the game has two levels of reading: the tale of Pankapu, epic and na\u00efve, and the one about Djaha\u2019rell's life, in the real-world, dark and tragic.",

Control Mario or Luigi in order to punch the enemies coming out of pipes from below to turn them over and then defeat them. In the two-player mode, both players can choose to work together or work against each other and enjoy the game in a myriad of ways.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

Population: 80 nutcases. \n\nA haunted hotel, an abandoned circus, a burnt-out pillow factory, a dead body pixelating under the bridge, toilets that run on vacuum tubes... you\u2019ve never visited a place like this before. \n\nFive people with nothing in common have been drawn to this rundown, forgotten town. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they are all deeply connected. And they\u2019re being watched.\n\n...Who is Agent Ray really working for and will she get what they want? ...What does Junior Agent Reyes know about a 20 year old factory fire that he\u2019s not saying? ...Will the ghost, Franklin, get to speak to his daughter again? ...Will Ransome the *Beeping* Clown ever become a decent human being? ...Will aspiring game developer Delores abandon her dreams and stick by her family? ...And most importantly: how come no one cares about that dead body?\n\nBy the end of a long, strange night in Thimbleweed Park, all of this will be answered -- and you\u2019ll question everything you thought you knew.\n\nIn a town like Thimbleweed Park, a dead body is the least of your problems.\n\nKey Features: - From Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, creators of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. - A neo-noir mystery set in 1987. - 5 playable characters who can work together... or get on each other\u2019s nerves. - Not a walking simulator! - Satisfying puzzles intertwined with a twisty-turny story that will stay with you. - A vast, bizarre world to explore at your own pace. - A joke every 2 minutes... guaranteed!* - Casual and Hard modes with varied difficulty. - English voices with English, German, French, Italian, Russian, and Spanish subtitles. *Not a guarantee.",

You'll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you but you'll have to figure out just how exactly they'll aide you in building and defending your Kingdom.\n\nKingdom: New Lands features: \u25cf One ruler, their horse, and a bag of coins \u25cf Greedy creatures trying to take your coins and crown every night (stop them!) \u25cf Loyal subjects who will help build, attack and defend your Kingdom \u25cf Multiple upgrades for your homestead, different unit types to attack and defend, and secrets littered throughout the land \u25cf Beautiful soundtrack that has received two honorable mentions from the Independent Games Festival\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.",

        "description": "The Bridge is a logic puzzle game that forces you to reevaluate your preconceptions of physics and perspective. It is Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher. Manipulate gravity to redefine the ceiling as the floor while venturing through impossible architectures. Explore increasingly difficult worlds, each uniquely detailed and designed to leave you with a pronounced sense of intellectual accomplishment. The Bridge exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art in the style of a black-and-white lithograph.\n\nKey Features: * 48 thought-provoking puzzles, each unique from the rest, all requiring an innovative solution. * Gravity manipulations, gravitational vortexes, parallel dimensions, and many more mind-bending concepts in a world where the laws of physics are not what they seem. * M. C. Escher-esque worlds with impossible architecture set in the style of beautifully hand-drawn black-and-white lithographic art. * An alternate version of the game unlocked after the main storyline has been completed, including challenging alternate versions of each of the 24 main puzzles, along with an alternate ending. * A time-backtracking system to alleviate any fears of making a mistake.",

As an \"adept\" who possesses supernatural \"septimal powers,\" Gunvolt fights for the freedom of the nation from the tyrannical rule of the massive conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group and the invasion of a super-powerful group of adepts known as Eden.\n\nAzure Striker Gunvolt's deep storyline plays out both during breaks in the action and in the thick of battle too! Featuring a robust cast of characters that are fully voiced (in Japanese) and over 25 vocal tracks performed by characters in the game, the world of Gunvolt provides excitement at every turn.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch\u2122 version also features a slew of upgrades from the Nintendo 3DS\u2122 version, including a 60 FPS upgrade, upgraded UI, high-resolution event graphics, the entire DLC catalog from the Nintendo 3DS\u2122 version pre-loaded into the game, a brand new vocal track from the character Lumen, AKA \"The Muse\", HD Rumble compatibility, and more!",

Simply undock the Switch to take your culinary adventures on the road, just like our plucky chefs travelling around the Onion Kingdom!\n\nThe Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.\n\nOvercooked Special Edition features all the exhilarating (and enraging) kitchens from the main game, as well as both expansions, \u2018The Lost Morsel\u2019 and \u2018Festive Seasoning\u2019.\n\nA CULINARY QUEST The Onion Kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual kitchens for you to conquer. Take part in an epic journey and tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens which will push your skills of co-operation and co-ordination to the very limits. Each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs.\n\nSIMPLE CONTROLS/DEEP CHALLENGE Overcooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a well-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!\n\nWith HD Rumble of Nintendo Switch\u2122, you become immersed in the crazy culinary antics like never before.\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY Whether indulging in deep fried local co-op or saut\u00e9ed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.\n\nJust like cooking itself, Overcooked is best enjoyed with friends! Call in backup from a buddy by detaching the Joy-Con\u2122 and get to work! Add in an extra set of Joy Con\u2122 or two Pro Controllers and you can play with up to four players for even more frantic fun.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!",

Every time you play the game the levels will be different and present unique challenges and opportunities.\n\n- UNLOCKS! You'll be able to choose from a variety of passive and active abilities at the beginning of each run so be sure to experiment with all of them and find the play style that best suits you.\n\n- SECRETS! Secret areas exist in the world of GoNNER, and these areas will get you different items that you can then always use from the beginning of each run. We're not going to tell you how you get to these areas or what the criteria is for even finding them because secrets, duh.\n\n- MUSIC! It's really freaking good.\n\nGood luck.",

After customising a character with a variety of arms, the player holds one Joy-Con in each hand and throws left and right punches at the opponent. Characters can jump and dash, and players can bend their punches by twisting their hands as they swing. As players learn the game and improve their skills, they will discover a deeper level of advanced tactics. Players can compete against the computer, against a friend on a split screen using a second set of Joy-Con (sold separately), against worldwide rivals online, or with two Nintendo Switch consoles over a local wireless connection.",

The new Burst Combo system rewards you for finishing off enemies and bosses up close and personal, and the Dowsing ability triggers the HD rumble when you get close to one of the many hidden items/areas in the game.\n\nThe classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to blur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden age of 2D action games!",

In each level, your boss gives you a job. Automate it by programming your little office worker. If you succeed, you'll be promoted up to the next level for another year of work in the vast office building. Congratulations!\n\nDon't worry if you've never programmed before - programming is just puzzle solving. If you strip away all the 1's and 0's and scary squiggly brackets, programming is actually really simple, logical, beautiful, and something that anyone can understand and have fun with! Are you already an expert? There will be extra challenges for you.\n\nFrom the creators of World of Goo and Little Inferno. Have fun! Management is watching.",

        "description": "Blaster Master Zero is an action-exploration game done in an 8-bit top-down & side-view style that hearkens back to the golden age of the NES. \n\nUsing the original 1988 NES title \"Blaster Master\" from Sunsoft as a base, Blaster Master Zero has many new additions, such as new areas and bosses, new gameplay elements such as extra sub-weapons, improved gameplay, a more robust scenario, refined and expanded exploration mechanics, and more. \n\nIn the near future on Earth, a young man named Jason Frudnick boards the battle vehicle SOPHIA III and sets off on an adventure in the subterranean depths of the planet. \n\nOn the side-view maps, take control of SOPHIA III and explore your surroundings as you search for the entrance to the dungeon where the area's boss lurks. \n\nOnce you find the dungeon entrance, exit SOPHIA III and make your way inside as Jason and take on the mutants inside in top-down mode.\n\nDefeat the mid-bosses and area bosses to acquire new items, sub-weapons, upgrades to SOPHIA III and Jason's equipment, and new abilities and move to the next area. \n\nWhat awaits Jason at the end of his long adventure...?",

        "description": "The Master Trials includes the following content:\n\nTrial of the Sword In the Trial of the Sword, you start with no weapons or equipment and must fight your way through 45 rooms of fierce enemies. Your only tools will be those you gather along the way. But the reward for completing such a gruelling challenge is great: finishing the trial will make the Master Sword even more powerful.\n\nHero's Path Mode A map update that allows you to see the path you've travelled. About 200 hours of gameplay can be tracked on the map this way. When watching your path unfold, you can adjust the replay speed to trace your past movements faster or slower. This mode may help you find shrines you've missed by showing the areas you've yet to explore.\n\nMaster Mode Master Mode increases the level of all monsters. For example, red Bokoblins will become blue Bokoblins, and you'll encounter powerful new enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode. Monsters will also slowly recover health and will be able to detect you more easily. You may even see enemies and treasure chests appear in mid-air.\n\nTravel Medallion An item, found in a hidden treasure chest, that allows you to register your current location as a travel gate on the map. You can only register one travel gate at a time.\n\n8 hidden items for you to find The following items, which pay tribute to The Legend of Zelda series, can now be found in treasure chests scattered across Hyrule: Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor and Phantom Greaves. Can you follow the hints and find them all?\n\nKorok Mask The Korok Mask is found in a new, hidden treasure chest. If equipped, the mask will shake to inform you when a Korok is nearby.",

Use them wisely!\n\n3 Game Modes are in the game. First, there is the Story Mode, where you set out with the help of your lovely assistant, Jessica, to build your dream town from scratch, overcome all sorts of obstacles, and aim to develop into a city. Then, there is the Survival Mode, where you can choose from 5 levels of difficulty to suit your pace of gameplay.

Even the next victim. \n\nDorota Shaw is dead. And the prime suspects are three tarot readers with the uncanny ability to predict murder - or commit it. It\u2019s your job to find out what else they know - but they won\u2019t reveal their dark secrets to just anyone\u2026 Luckily, you can be anyone you want to be.\n\nThe game features more than 1600 full HD video responses, a simple questioning interface with unique \u2018delete\u2019 mechanic, and a randomly chosen murderer at the start of the game. Developed by the World Record-breaking makers of \"The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker\".\n\n\u25cf Shapeshift - into nine other characters so you can investigate and manipulate relationships from all angles, and unlock the other half of the story. \u25cf Suspense - solve a murder, stop a murder, don\u2019t get caught. Any one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers. \u25cf Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and break relationships \u2013 or don\u2019t. \u25cf Problem solving - can\u2019t get that vital clue yourself? Try shapeshifting into the Police Chief. Think the dialogue options are a trap? Delete them. \u25cf 100% FMV - an entire game of smooth FMV cutscenes and responses in first person perspective. \u25cf Catalytic events - not all branching is binary. Push someone into a corner and they may have more than one way to react. ",

Memorize drum lines and jam to 13 tracks without any sheet music or rhythm icons. How you rock is up to you!\n\nHold the Joy-Con\u2122 in your left and right hand as if they were real drum sticks and make music by swinging them up and down. (Gal Metal also supports standard button and Touch Screen input.)\n\nSwing the Joy-Con\u2122 (R) for the kick drum, the Joy-Con\u2122 (L) for the snare drum, and both at the same time for a cymbal crash. \n\nMemorize various rhythm patterns by practicing solo or with your band and deploy them however you like to build up your Metal Power in concert battles against the Octoids.\n\nJust using a single beat won\u2019t be enough to rack up the points \u2014 showcase a variety of rhythm patterns and earn yourself combo bonuses. Master the art of metal and send those nasty aliens back where they came from!",

        "description": "In the spotlight and under pressure, a series of walls are coming straight at you! Each wall has a gap cut out in a different body shape. Hold a Joy-Con\u2122 in each hand and move your arms to match the shape and slip through the gap! Sounds easy? It is at first, but the gaps get smaller and the walls get faster. How long can you survive before you're plunged into the slime? Practice alone or play together for some serious fun!\n\n4 types of games! Classic, High Speed, Memory and Mirror will keep you on your toes.\n\nThree game modes! Challenge Practice and aim for the highest score.\n\nVersus Split screen head-to-head action! The pressure mounts as the walls keep coming!\n\nArms & Legs Control the movement of the left or right arm, or the left or right leg with a single Joy-Con\u2122. Each time the round finishes the limb you control changes (but you're not told to which one). Quickly find your arm/leg and move it to fit through the gap as the wall approaches. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.",

So they tied them together to a tiny monstrous chain and let them make their way through colourfull, tricky, cooperative experimental set-ups that only scientists can think up.\n\nAnybody complained the plot is as flat as 2D? Bullseye! You are right. The unbelievable truth is: YOU are the monsters and WE are the scientists. Get tied to your friends and we will test your cooperation skills and creativity! And we will even test your friendship...\n\nSingle players don\u2019t even have a chance to handle the monster\u2019s challenges. Also, it's a lot more fun to play with friends instead of playing alone, right?!? As a team you have to coordinate movement, jumps and cling to ground and walls to complete the levels and stay alive. That\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, but all the funnier! And every time your monstrous cooperative skills are not enough it will end up in great chaos \u2013 and great laughter.\n\nCome on, subject, what about your friendship and cooperative skills?\n\nFun-tied features: - Play our award-winning highly funny local co-op 2D party game! - Tons of cooperative and non-violent fun for the whole family - from child to granny! - Over 40 challenging levels in the Duo Mode (2 players) - And more than 20 tricky levels in the Party Mode (3 or 4 players) - Finish the levels as fast as possible and earn Gold, Silver or Bronze based on your time! - Let the tied-together co-op fun begin!
